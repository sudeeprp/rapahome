<h1>Chapter 13</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The first six chapters described Krishna as
the Supreme Lord and the <a href="Back%20to%20Basics.html#Moksha">ultimate achievement</a>
. To achieve
Him, those chapters described <a href="Chapter%207.html#bhakti_a_defn">devotion</a>
 as a part
of the Lord's worship. They also described the techniques of <a href="Chapter%203.html#jnAnayOga_a_defn">contemplation</a>
 and <a href="Back%20to%20Basics.html#karmayOga_a_defn">activity</a>

as 'means' to achieve that devotion.  </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The second set of six chapters described
The Lord as the ultimate goal, His true form and His greatness. They
recommended abundant and single-minded love for Him in the form of devotion.
Awareness of the Lord leads to such devotion.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
It was also stated that devotion is
effective in achieving great wealth in this world, the curiosity to experience
the Self and other goals as well.</span>
</p>

</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The next six chapters offer clarity about
the material environment and the Self. They also describe how their combination
forms this world. These chapters also clarify the methods to achieve our goal, along
with the associated actions, awareness and devotion - which were stated in the
last twelve chapters.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
This is the thirteenth chapter and it
describes the nature of the Self and the body. This chapter clarifies the true
nature of the body and lays down the means to achieve the Self, separate from
the body. It gives clarity on the characteristics of this Self. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
This chapter also explains why the Self is
attached to inanimate matter. It describes methods to distinguish these
attachments.</span>

<span class="snskrtphrase">[kShEtrajna iti]</span></span>

<span lang=EN-US >
This
body tends to be equated to the Self, resulting in opinions such as 'I am
powerful', 'I am human', 'I am fat' or 'I am thin'. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
However, the body and the Self are
distinct. The Self is the one who experiences. This body is to be experienced
by the Self. That's why the body is called the 'field' where experiences are
made - those who know the true nature of the body say this.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The person who is aware of this is known to
have distinguished the Self. He is aware of something inside, which says 'I
know this', while being covered by organs and being in association with them.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The person who has realized the true nature
of the Self recognizes that the body is to be known, that the Self is the
'knower' and is distinct from the body.</span>
</p>


<table class=ApplNotes border=0><tr><td class=ApplNotes align="center"><img class=ApplNotesImg src="step_1.png"></td><td><p class=ApplNotes id=inlineapplnote174 >

The knower of the body
is not the body, it is the Self.</span>
</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
When we deal with things that are separate
from our body - such as a clay pot - it is common to distinguish it from
ourselves. We're aware that 'I am a human' and that 'I know it's a pot'.  </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
While we tend to equate the one who knows -
the Self - with our body, we still perceive that we know our body. We realize
that 'I know my body'. This is illustrated in experiences which make us say
things like 'I feel pain in my stomach'.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Like the pot, the body is separate from the
Self. The Self is the one who 'knows' and the body is the one which is 'known'.
Thus, the body is distinct from the Self. Likewise, the Self is distinct, being
the 'knower of the field'. It is the knower of the body and the environment.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The belief that they both are equivalent
comes from the presentation of the body as an inseparable attribute of the
Self, like 'cowness' is an inseparable attribute of a cow. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The unique qualities of the Self, as the
knower, are not apparent to organs such as our eyes. Our minds are formed by
contact with the environment, with the environment being a source of
experiences. People who don't know the nature of the Self and the environment
see the body as the 'knower'. The body is actually a part of the environment.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
As said in <a href="Chapter%2015.html#10">Chapter 15-10</a>: 'The body is a
product of the <a href="Chapter%202.html#satva_rajas_tamas">three qualities</a>
. Ignorant
people are unable to recognize the Self - The Self is the one who experiences.
Its experiences are painted with these <a href="Chapter%202.html#satva_rajas_tamas">three
qualities</a>
, while being in the body and initiating activities like eating. While
in ignorance, they are unable to recognize that the Self departs from the body
at the time of death. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
On the other hand, those who have the sight
of knowledge do see this Self as being distinct'.</span>

The following commentary illustrates the
relationship of the environment, the body and the Lord. Name anything in the environment;
it has a Self embedded in it. The environment needs a Self to be recognized. In
that context, the body is an inseparable attribute of the Self. The Self uses
the body to experience the environment. The Lord is the controller. Though the
Self and the environment </span>

<span lang=EN-US >
<a href="Chapter%207.html#TwoNatures_univrs_and_ultimate"><i >
exist as the body</i>
</a>
<i >
 of the
Lord, they are distinct with their own characteristics. However, the Lord has
said in this shloka: Know me to be the knower. Does it mean He is the Self
within us? Or is the Self distinct from the Lord? To clarify this, many
scriptures are quoted, many questions are asked and answered in the following
commentary.</i>
</span>

<span lang=EN-US style='color:black' >
That which knows the
Self is the Lord. Doesn't that make the Self redundant? Is it same as the Lord?</span>
</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The capability to 'know' is the single
characteristic of the Self in every body. It doesn't depend on the
characteristics of the body - whether it's ordinary, powerful, intelligent, ugly
or beautiful.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The Lord is the essence of the Self. Krishna
tells Arjuna to know this.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
In this Shloka, the phrase 'as well' in the
statement 'Know Me to be the knower as well' implies that the Lord must be
known as the '<a href="Chapter%2013.html#field_and_knower_of_field">knower</a>
' as well as the '<a href="Chapter%2013.html#field_and_knower_of_field">field of action</a>
'. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
A living body merely qualifies the Self and
doesn't exist without it. When we point out someone's body, we address their
Self. They are both referenced in the same way. Similarly, the body and the
Self exist as inseparable attributes of the Lord. The Lord refers to the Self
as Himself in this Shloka.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Our body is a combination of the five elements
of the environment - solids, liquids, energy, gasses and space. Both our body
and the Self exist <a href="Chapter%207.html#universe_as_his_body">as the body of the Lord</a>
.
They don't have any other existence. In other words, both of them have the Lord
as their essence. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
This is stated in many scriptures, which
are listed here:</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The </span>
<span lang=EN-US style='font-size:9.0pt;line-height:150%' >
[br'hadArAnyaka, 3-7-3] states</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
: 'The One who is inside all matter, while being distinct it; The
One whom matter cannot encode; The One who has all matter <a href="Chapter%207.html#universe_as_his_body">as his body</a>
; The One who controls all matter
from the inside - Such a Self is all-pervasive and ever-lasting'. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Starting with that statement, it finishes
describing the concept in </span>
<span lang=EN-US style='font-size:9.0pt;
line-height:150%' >
[br'hadArAnyaka, 3-77-22]</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
: 'The One
who is present inside the Self, who is distinct from the Self; The One whom the
Self does not know; The One who has the Self <a href="Chapter%207.html#TwoNatures_univrs_and_ultimate">as His body</a>
; The one who controls
the body from within - that is the essence of your Self, it is ever-lasting'.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The Lord is all-pervasive and is present as
the essence of every Self. Hence, when we point out anything, we are actually
addressing the Lord. It is stated in the following Shlokas:</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
<a href="Chapter%2010.html#20">Chapter 10-20</a>: 'I am situated in all beings at
their core as the Self. Moreover, I am the beginning, as well as the end and
everything in-between'</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
<a href="Chapter%2010.html#39">Chapter 10-39</a>: 'Whatever is the source of all
beings, I am that. It is impossible for any being, moving or stationary, to
exist without Me'</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
<a href="Chapter%2010.html#42">Chapter 10-42</a>: 'I support and control this
entire universe, which is situated in one part of My being.'</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
In the second half of the tenth chapter, the
Lord described that he is the Self, the essence of everything. In the midst of that
description, the Lord described Himself as many special things by saying 'I am
Vishnu', 'I am the sun' and so on. For instance, He says in <a href="Chapter%2010.html#21">Chapter 10-21</a>: 'In the
<a href="Chapter%204.html#gods_and_other_powers">powers of nature</a>
, I am Vishnu, the
all-pervasive. In all luminous things, I am the sun that has the greatest
brightness. Among the powers of war, I am the most powerful. Among the stars, I
appear as the moon'</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The difference between kshetra and
kshetrajna and the fact that I am the Self to both of them - that is the awareness
you must have.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
In this Shloka, He says - 'Learn to differentiate
the <a href="Chapter%2013.html#field_and_knower_of_field">field of action</a>
 and the one who
experiences this field. I recommend you to realize that I am the essence of
both'.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<i >
<span lang=EN-US >
The following paragraph tries out an opposing
explanation, which ends in contradiction.</span>
</i>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
In this Shloka, the Lord has said - 'Know
Me to be the knower'. This can be interpreted as a statement of equivalence, to
mean that the Lord and the Self are the same entity. The Self within us hasn't
realized that it is the Lord. This leads to the conclusion that the Lord, being
present as the Self, does not realize Himself to be the Lord - due to
ignorance. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
We could hypothesize that such statements
of equivalence are meant to get rid of such ignorance: For example, we may
mistake a rope to be a snake. When someone shows us that it's only a rope, our
ignorance is gone. In the same way, what if our awareness that 'I am aware and
I'm distinct from the Lord' is ignorance and this Shloka aims to remove such
ignorance?</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<i >
<span lang=EN-US >
Now the contradiction is presented.</span>
</i>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >

Those who argue in this manner say that the
Lord and the Self are the same entity. They are to be questioned: 'The Lord,
who has taught us all this - Lord Krishna - is He free from the so-called 'ignorance',
which says that the Self and the Lord are distinct? Or not? </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
If He is free of such 'ignorance', then His
Self has the characteristic of pure knowledge. Being devoid of any other
attribute, there is no possibility to consider Arjuna to be distinct from
Himself. Hence, there's no possibility to explain anything and get rid of
anyone's ignorance.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
On the other hand, if we consider that
Krishna is not free of ignorance, not having realized the Self, then the
possibility to teach the subject of the Self does not arise. </span>

<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Thus, such arguments, which say that the
Lord and the Self are not distinct, go against the scriptures and other Shlokas

must not be accepted, since they only serve to mislead everyone. </span>

</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<i >
<span lang=EN-US >
Let's look at our origin</span>
</i>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Even in the Gita, there are many verses
that state the origin of the Self and the universe:</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
<a href="Chapter%207.html#4">Chapter 7-4</a>, <a href="Chapter%207.html#5">Chapter 7-5</a>: 'This universe of mine
is divided into eight categories: Solids, liquids, energy, gasses, space, mind,
the gross collections and the notion of individuality. However, this universe I
just described is not the ultimate one. Know My ultimate nature, which is
something distinct, in the form of a conscious being by whom this world is
sustained'</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
<a href="Chapter%209.html#7">Chapter 9-7</a>, <a href="Chapter%209.html#8">Chapter 9-8</a>, <a href="Chapter%209.html#10">Chapter 9-10</a>: 'All beings
end up in a dormant state in My body at the end of a <a href="Chapter%204.html#kalpa_definition"><span style='color:windowtext;text-decoration:none' >

</a>
. Again, at the
beginning of the next <a href="Chapter%204.html#kalpa_definition"><span style='color:windowtext;
text-decoration:none' >
kalpa</span>
</a>
, I create them in various forms. I
create this entire system of beings again and again, while keeping My material
nature as the basis. Since they are under the influence of the material world,
they are not free. These activities of mine don't bind Me. Being neutral, I
have no attachment towards those activities. The material environment guides
this world with all its stationary and mobile beings according to My will. I am
the supreme controller. This world goes through its cycles for this purpose
itself'</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
<a href="Chapter%2013.html#14">Chapter 13-14</a>: Know the environment and the
Self to be without a beginning.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
<a href="Chapter%2014.html#3">Chapter 14-3</a>: This huge universe is my
creation. In that, I give birth. Then, the birth of all beings takes place.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Meaning - The huge universe arises from the
subtle matter, which is an attribute of mine. In this environment, which is
without consciousness, I place the womb of consciousness. This association of
the conscious Self and the non-conscious environment happens by My will. Such
association gives rise to all beings in the material world, from the mighty and
powerful right upto the immobile.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
In this Shloka, the environment - the huge
universe - is called </span>
<span lang=EN-US >
[brahma]</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
.
It doesn't mean that it's the same as The Lord, who is also called by the same
word. The word </span>
<span lang=EN-US >
[brahma]</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
 is used
to refer to our environment in other scriptures as well. For example, </span>
<span lang=EN-US style='font-size:9.0pt;line-height:150%' >
[muMDaka] 1-1-9</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
 says: 'From that, the universe called as </span>
<span lang=EN-US >
[brahma]</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
, arises'.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
In this way, the conscious and
non-conscious exist as those who experience and that which is experienced. They
exist in this way in all states of being. The Lord is the inseparable essence
of their existence. Several scriptures state this fact and they are quoted here
once again:</span>

</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Similarly, other scriptures describe how
the Lord is related to the Self:</span>

Identical statements are present in </span>
<span lang=EN-US style='font-size:9.0pt;line-height:150%' >
[subAla upanishat]</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
, illustrating that the universe, our environment and the Self are
the <a href="Chapter%207.html#universe_as_his_body">body of the Lord</a>
: 'The One who is active
inside the earth; The One <a href="Chapter%207.html#universe_as_his_body">whose body is the
earth</a>
; The One whom the earth does not know', 'The One who is active in the

The One <a href="Chapter%207.html#universe_as_his_body">whose body it is</a>
; The one whom the
perishable does not know. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
In this way, Lord Narayana is the core Self
of all beings, untainted by actions, distinct from the material world, shining
forth, the one and only supreme entity. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
This Upanishad uses the word 'perishable'
to refer to everything without consciousness, which existed in <a href="Chapter%2013.html#subtle_singularity">subtle form</a>
 before creation. It is also called [tamas].
The usage of the word [tamas] to mean the <a href="Chapter%2013.html#subtle_singularity">subtle
environment</a>
 is evident in the same Upanishad: 'The body perishes in the
Self and becomes subtle, taking the state of [tamas]'.</span>

In this way, everything exists <a href="Chapter%207.html#universe_as_his_body">as the Lord's body</a>
, be it conscious or non-conscious,
in every state of being. In fact, everything is a form of the Lord Himself. The
Lord Himself exists as the origin of the universe, as a <a href="Chapter%2013.html#subtle_singularity">subtle singularity</a>

the effect as well, which is the entire universe after creation. </span>

<p class=MsoNormal >

Though the Lord has the Self and the
environment <a href="Chapter%207.html#universe_as_his_body">as His body</a>

the material cause of their association, He remains distinct from them - the
characteristics of the Lord are not mixed up with the characteristics of the

</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Just as colorful threads that are white,
black or red come together to create cloth, the thread and the cloth remain
distinct with different characteristics. While threads are the only material
cause of a colorful cloth, each color is localized to the thread that went into
making the cloth - even in the resulting cloth, the colors don't mix. The
characteristics of the cloth are distinct from those of the threads.</span>

<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The Self, the environment and the Lord combine
to be the material cause of this world. While they are effects of the Lord's
creation, their characteristics don't get mixed up. The Self remains the one
who experiences; the environment is the one that's experienced and the Lord is
the One who controls.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Threads, which normally remain separate,
are woven together at the will of a weaver at some instant. These threads are
both the material cause and the effect. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Similarly, the Self and the environment in
all states of being - either the subtle form before creation or the gross form
after creation - are the <a href="Chapter%207.html#universe_as_his_body">body of the Lord</a>
.
They exist as entities only in the form of the <a href="Chapter%207.html#universe_as_his_body">Lord's
body</a>
. Their form is the Lord Himself, both as the cause and the observed
effect. He is the One addressed by all words, all the time - This is His specialty.
</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The environment, the Self and the Lord have
distinct characteristics - The environment is inanimate, without consciousness;
The Self is knowledge, which is limited in its expression according to the
actions committed by the Self; The Lord always has infinite knowledge. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
As in the case of threads combining to make
cloth, their characteristics remain distinct and don't get mixed up. Given
this, it's easy to recognize that the Lord's characteristic remains unchanged
even after He enters everything in the created universe. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
We realize again: In addition to being the
cause, The Lord is also the effect of creation with its variety of entities
that have various names and classifications. The Lord is present as the
Ultimate Self inside everything. The word 'effect' just means that a different
state of being is attained.</span>

<p class=MsoNormal >

Those who vouch for the Lord as being
'without form and without qualities' mean that the Lord is devoid of any

The Lord is without limitations. The word '<a href="Chapter%202.html#satva_rajas_tamas">qualities</a>

Certain scriptures describe the Lord as

In this way, the scriptures that describe
the distinct forms and characteristics of the Self, the environment and the
Lord do not contradict the other scriptures that hold out the singularity of
cause and effect, describing everything as the Lord Himself. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The Self and the environment exist <a href="Chapter%207.html#universe_as_his_body">as the body of the Lord</a>
 always. They have the
Lord at the core, controlling them. This holds good in the subtle form in which
they were present before creation - when they could not be distinguished by
form and name. It also holds in their explicit form after creation, when they
can be distinguished by names. This is known from all scriptures. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
If we take the scriptures stating the
singularity of the Lord literally, then the Self would itself be the Lord, then
the Lord would have ignorance. This goes against all knowledge in the
scriptures. There is no scope of maintaining this kind of singularity.</span>

<p class=MsoNormal >

Parashara was a great sage who described
the three elements in the Vishnu Purana - the Self, the environment and the

<p class=MsoNormal >

<span lang=EN-US >
There, he explains the three elements
through an anecdote: There was once a king called Bahuguna. He set out on a
palanquin, normally to be carried by four people. On that day, only three had
turned up. Three people couldn't hold it. Hence, the king called on Jadapradha,
who was standing by the side. Jadapradha was a sage with vast knowledge, but
looked quite ordinary. Hence the king mistook him for a commoner. Jadapradha
lifted the palanquin. However, due to lack of practice, he did not lift well. </span>
</i>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<i >
<span lang=EN-US >
The king reprimanded him and Jadapradha
replied - 'When you told me to lift this, did you tell my body or my Self? What
lifted it? The body or the Self? What are you and what am I? Hearing this, the
king realized that the person is no commoner. He requested Jadapradha to teach
him. A part of that teaching follows now:</span>

<p class=MsoNormal >

<p class=MsoNormal >

<p class=MsoNormal >

); From these fields, energy
came into being; From energy, fluids arose; Fluids became solids and planets.
From the material of the planets arose organic compounds. Food in the form of
vegetation is formed out of these compounds. From this food, the body of a
person comes into being. Thus, a person is made from food and liquids'.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The Upanishad described the nature of the
body as being made out of food. It goes on to state that the body has the
breath of life and is pervaded by a mind. The Self resides in the body that's
pervaded by the mind. Yet, it is distinct from the body and the mind. </span>

<p class=MsoNormal >

this way, it goes on to say: 'This Self has the Ultimate Self residing in it,
being with infinite knowledge and filled with pure joy'. </span>

<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
In this way, the Vedas clearly state the
distinction between the nature of the body and the mind. They state the fact
that both of them have the Lord at their core. The Lord is the Ultimate Self.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The verses of the Brahmasutra describe the
Lord as the owner of the Self and the body. They do so with conviction and
logic. They start by establishing that space itself did not exist forever, that
it came into existence at the time of creation. They go on to describe the
nature of the body - the <a href="Chapter%2013.html#field_and_knower_of_field">field of action</a>
.
Then they describe the true form of the Self - the Self always exists in the
form of awareness.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Finally, they describe the relation between
the Self and the Lord, by saying that the Self is a doer of actions. That
doership is entirely under the will of the Lord. The Lord sets the Self into
action - even in this way, the Self has the Lord at its core. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The reality of the Self and its field of
action have been elaborated in various scriptures in many ways. The Lord says -
'Now listen to Me, I will describe it in a clear and brief way'. </span>

<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
This Shloka begins with: 'The five
elements; prior to those, the sub-atomic particles; before that, the state of
expansion; before creation, the universe in subtle form'. This list described
the ingredients involved in the origin of the body. The body is made from the
five elements - solids, liquids, energy, gasses and space. These five elements
originated from the particles that were formed during creation. These particles
resulted from the state of expansion, also termed as cosmic inflation. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<a name="subtle_singularity" >
</a>
<span lang=EN-US >
Before the
state of expansion, all of this existed in a subtle form, incapable of being
distinguished with names. That is the 'subtle singularity'.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The 'ten organs with the mind and the five
stimuli' are the entities that have the body as their home. Our ears, nose,
eyes, tongue and skin are the five sense organs. Speech, hands, legs and the
two excretory organs are the organs of action. The mind has the body as its
home too, as do the five stimuli of the senses - sound, touch, form, taste and
smell.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Feelings of desire, hatred, comfort and
sorrow are associated with the body. Hence, they are considered to be
variations in the state of the body.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
To clarify: Though desire, hatred, comfort,
sorrow are experienced by the Self, those experiences come out of its
association with the body. Since these experiences are effects of the body,
they are considered as different states of the body. This is stated later in
this chapter, <a href="Chapter%2013.html#_20_1"><a href="Chapter%2013.html#20">Chapter 13-20</a></a>
: 'The Self experiences comfort
and sorrow by virtue of being associated with the body'. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
A combination of all these elements
constitutes the body, which exists as a base on which the Self can experience
feelings such as comfort and sorrow. The body is the base for worldly
experience as well as the achievement of <a href="Back%20to%20Basics.html#Moksha">Moksha</a>
. That is
why this Shloka states that 'The body supports the existence a conscious
being'.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
In this way, the <a href="Chapter%2013.html#field_and_knower_of_field">field of action</a>
 - our body - started with
the environment in the <a href="Chapter%2013.html#subtle_singularity">subtle singularity</a>
 and
ended up in this world. It is made out of the five elements, contains the
organs and undergoes change due to love, hatred, comfort or pain. It is a
combination of all these entities, existing as a base for the conscious Self to
have its experiences. This is our body in brief, along with its various states.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Next, the Lord describes the virtues that go
with Self-awareness. These virtues are present in the activities of our body.</span>

Let's now
examine each of the virtues mentioned in this Shloka, which go with Self-realization.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Being 'without a sense of superiority' is
about being without disrespect towards great people; </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Being 'without hypocrisy' - hypocrisy is
when the path of duty is followed for the sake of gaining fame. This is about
being free from the goal of achieving fame; </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Having no intention to harm anyone, either
through speech, deeds or thought; </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
'Being without agitation' is about having
an unchanged attitude towards those who trouble and provoke; </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
'Consistency in thought, speech and deed' -
saying what we intend, doing what we say; </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
'Respect and adoration towards the teacher'
is about committing to respect, inquire and serve a teacher who bestows Self-awareness;</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
'Cleanliness' is the awareness of the Self
- keeping the body, mind and speech fit to achieve that awareness; </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Being 'steadfast' in the quest for the
knowledge of the Self; </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
'Self-discipline' is to restrain the organs
from subjects that are opposed to the awareness of the Self.</span>

Lord described the Self as 'the one who is aware'. Next, He clarifies the nature
of the Self along with its awareness.</span>

<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The Lord continues - </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The Self is always evident to us. Its
nature must be grasped by the <a href="Chapter%2013.html#virtues_amanitvam">virtues described
before</a>
 in <a href="Chapter%2013.html#7">Chapter 13-7</a>. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
I will clarify the nature of the Self now.
You will grasp the Self with this knowledge. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
By nature, the Self is not subject to the
laws of the material world. It is free of birth, old age and death. It has no
beginning, likewise no ending either. This is said in </span>
<span lang=EN-US style='font-size:9.0pt;line-height:150%' >
[kaTha upanishat]</span>
<span lang=EN-US style='font-size:9.0pt;line-height:150%' >
, 2-18</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
: 'It is not born, does not perish, it is full of wisdom'. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The Self realizes My supremacy, as I said
in <a href="Chapter%207.html#5">Chapter 7-5</a>: 'Know My ultimate nature in the form of a conscious being, by whom
this world is sustained'</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
By being the <a href="Chapter%207.html#universe_as_his_body">body
of the Lord</a>
, It is in the very nature of the Self to enjoy being under the
service of the Lord. This is said in the </span>

: He is the owner of both

</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The knowledge in the Self is infinite. It
is distinct from the body and not bound by it. As said in </span>
<span lang=EN-US style='font-size:9.0pt;line-height:150%' >
[shvEtAshvatara]</span>
<span lang=EN-US style='font-size:9.0pt;line-height:150%' >
, 5-9</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
: The Self is able to achieve the state of boundlessness. Being
bound to a body is the outcome of the actions committed by the Self. When the
Self is free from the bonds of action, it <a href="Back%20to%20Basics.html#Moksha">reaches infinity</a>
.
</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The word </span>
<span lang=EN-US >
[brahma]</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
 in this chapter refers to the unbound Self. The word </span>
<span lang=EN-US >
[brahma]</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
 is used this way in other Shlokas
too - as in <a href="Chapter%2014.html#26">Chapter 14-26</a>: 'With focused devotion, a person completely overcomes
the three qualities and is cut out to </span>
<span lang=EN-US >
[brahmabhUya]</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
 - the experience the Self in its true form' and in <a href="Chapter%2018.html#54">Chapter 18-54</a>:
'Having realized the Self, with a serene mind, he doesn't get upset and doesn't
yearn. Such a person realizes the equivalence among all beings. He attains
ultimate <a href="Chapter%207.html#bhakti_a_defn">devotion to Me</a>
'.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The last part of this Shloka says - 'This
state is not the one in which the Self is bound to this environment. It is also
not the state when the Self is present in the <a href="Chapter%2013.html#subtle_singularity">subtle
singularity</a>
'. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
When <a href="Back%20to%20Basics.html#Moksha">liberated</a>
, the
Self is not associated with being the cause, nor the effect. The words 'cause'
and 'effect' don't relate to the state of the Self. While interpreting this
Shloka, the word '</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
[sat]</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
' is
mapped to the state after creation, where things can be distinguished and be
named. '</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
[asat]</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
' is the state
before creation, when this could not be done. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
This interpretation is supported by the
scriptures:</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >

<span lang=EN-US style='color:black' >
Ignorance prevents the
Self from expressing its completeness</span>
</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The terms 'cause' and 'effect' are
applicable to the ignorance that sticks to the Self, by the influence of past
actions. They are not characteristic of the Self. Hence, these terms don't
describe the nature of the Self.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The phrase '</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
[asat]</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
 was the state that existed before all this' says that the universe
and its beings were the <a href="Chapter%207.html#universe_as_his_body">body of the Lord</a>

before creation, though in subtle form. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Before creation, the Lord had His body (the
universe) in subtle form. That was a state in which nothing could be
distinguished by a name. Even in this state, the Self is still bound to the
material world due to its actions. That does not describe its true nature.</span>

<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The pure and <a href="Back%20to%20Basics.html#Moksha">liberated</a>

Self is capable of doing anything that can be done by our organs. It has eyes,
heads and faces everywhere. It accomplishes all activities of these organs. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
In the scriptures, </span>
<span lang=EN-US style='font-size:9.0pt;line-height:150%' >
[svEtAshvatara]</span>
<span lang=EN-US style='font-size:9.0pt;line-height:150%' >
 3-19</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
 describes the Lord in this way: 'He moves about without using any
legs, grasps without hands, sees without eyes, listens without ears'. It means
the Lord can accomplish anything we do with our organs, while not being bound
by them. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
When <a href="Back%20to%20Basics.html#Moksha">liberated</a>
, the
pure Self is equivalent to the Lord. It can accomplish the same without needing
any organs. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >

: 'The one who practices

the Ultimate'. It is also said in <a href="Chapter%2014.html#2">Chapter 14-2</a>: 'Having gained this knowledge,
they achieve My characteristics'.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
This Shloka ended with: 'It is all-pervasive
in this world' - It pervades every entity that exists in this world. In its
pure form, the Self does not have constraints of space. Hence it pervades
everything.</span>

In its <a href="Back%20to%20Basics.html#Moksha">liberated</a>

<span lang=EN-US >
The Self is identical in all beings, in the
form of pure knowledge. To the ignorant, it seems to vary based on the form of
the being - some beings have a powerful form, some don't and so on. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Usually, the Self is equated to the body,
when we say 'I am powerful', 'I am ordinary' and so on. Yet, it is distinct
from the body - it is capable of awareness, while the body isn't.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
It is possible to know the Self, as
mentioned at the beginning of this chapter (<a href="Chapter%2013.html#2">Chapter 13-2</a>). It is possible to know
the Self as being distinct from the variety of bodies it occupies - this is
expressed here by the phrase 'It wears the form of the being it owns'. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
We must realize that the one who wears the
body - the Self - is distinct from the body itself. The body is formed by
bringing the elements of nature together. It is possible to know that the wearer
of the body is distinct from the body which is worn. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
This is illustrated in the Shloka with an
example: Our body absorbs nature. We eat things made from the elements of
nature, such as rice. It is possible to know ourselves as those who eat,
distinct from the food being eaten. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The Self in our body causes the
transformation of food. The food we eat transforms into tissues, blood and
other parts of the body, producing the experience of thriving growth and
sustenance. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The Self is distinct from that food, before
and after this transformation. This is evident by the fact that a dead body
does not transform food into anything. So, the combination of elements that
form the body cannot be the cause of this transformation.</span>

The Self alone shines brilliant, even when
it is among lamps, the sun and other bright things. It throws light on them -
The Self is what makes the experience of brightness happen. Things that give
light remove the darkness that blocks sight, nothing more. The Self alone
recognizes and experiences brightness.</span>

<span lang=EN-US >
The word </span>

<span lang=EN-US >
The Self is beyond the bounds of this

</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >

The Self itself is awareness. We must

 up
until <a href="Chapter%2013.html#_11_1"><a href="Chapter%2013.html#11">Chapter 13-11</a></a>

 and concluding with <a href="Chapter%2013.html#_17"><a href="Chapter%2013.html#17">Chapter 13-17</a></a>
. The Self was described as the one that must be recognized.
</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
After this, the Lord says - 'Knowing these
- the body, the Self being distinct from the body and the means to grasp the
true form of the Self - My devotee steps up to achieve equality with Me. He
steps up to achieve My characteristics, being independent of the material world.
This is his natural state'.</span>
</p>

The material environment and the Self have
vastly different characteristics. The next Shloka describes the beginning-less
bond between them, how they work in bondage and the reason for their bonding.</span>

</p>


</div>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The sense organs, organs of action and the
mind constitute the body. The body is made up of <a href="Chapter%2013.html#five_elements">elements</a>

of the environment. When the Self occupies a body, its organs become active.
These activities lead to experiences that keep happening, as long as the Self is
in the body. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The role of the Self is to preside over the
body and sustain it. In support of that fact, the Brahmasutra says: </span>
<span lang=EN-US style='font-size:8.0pt;line-height:150%' >
[</span>
<span lang=EN-US style='font-size:9.0pt;line-height:150%' >

<span lang=EN-US style='font-size:8.0pt;line-height:150%' >

</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
In summary:</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The Self presides over the body and
sustains it, bringing initiative - that's it. Experiences such as comfort and
pain come from its association with the material world. In other words, our
body is the field in which comfort and pain are experienced by the Self.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
In this way, the division of work between
the environment (the body) and the Self was described. It holds as long as the
Self and the body are bound together. </span>

<p class=MsoNormal >

Next, the reason for the Self to be bound

powerful being, as an ordinary human, as an animal or a lower life form. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
It has pursued desires, comforts and

virtue were committed, along with flaws and mistakes. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >

those initiatives.</span>

<span lang=EN-US >
<span class="snskrtphrase">[upadraShTA]</span></span>

It is the witness </span>

<span class="snskrtphrase">[anumantA cha]</span></span>
<span lang=EN-US >
 and the enabler. </span>
<span lang=EN-US >
<span class="snskrtphrase">[bhartA]</span></span>
<span lang=EN-US >
 It wears and holds the body. </span>
<span lang=EN-US >
<span class="snskrtphrase">[bhOktA]</span></span>
<span lang=EN-US >
 It is the one that experiences. </span>
<span lang=EN-US >

<span class="snskrtphrase">[paramAtmA iti cha api

<span lang=EN-US >
 It is also said to be the supreme person.</span>
</p>


</div>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The Self plays the role of a witness and <a href="Chapter%2013.html#self_initiates_action">enabler</a>
 while it's in a body- with its intentions
and initiatives that suit the body it occupies. In this way the Self holds the
body together. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
It also experiences the feelings of comfort
and sorrow that are generated by the tendencies of the body. In this way, the
Self is the owner of the body, its organs and the mind. It coordinates activities
by sustaining the body and by being its controller. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
A similar fact is stated later in
<a href="Chapter%2015.html#8">Chapter 15-8</a>: 'When the lord of the body takes leave of its environment (when it
leaves the body at the time of death), it takes the essence of the body along,
just as the wind takes the fragrance from a fragrant thing'.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The Self is also said to be the supreme
person in relation to the body, its organs and the mind. The Self in relation
to the body and the mind is described next in <a href="Chapter%2013.html#24">Chapter 13-24</a>: 'Some see the Self
inside their body through focused thought, using their mind'.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Notice the phrase [cha api] - 'also' in
this Shloka ('It is also said to be the supreme person'). It implies that the
Self is regarded as the supreme person, in addition to being the controller.
The superiority of the Self is described in <a href="Chapter%2013.html#12">Chapter 13-12</a>: 'The Self expands to
infinite knowledge, realizing that the Lord is supreme'.</span>

The Self has unbroken knowledge and

time. Due to this, it is attached to the <a href="Chapter%202.html#satva_rajas_tamas">three
qualities</a>
 and is the controller of this body, nothing more. It is said to
be supreme only in relation to the body.</span>

This Self is the supreme owner of the body

characteristics. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Even though the Self is inside the body, it
does not wear out and perish. To start with, it has no beginning. It does not
have the <a href="Chapter%202.html#satva_rajas_tamas">three qualities</a>
 in its nature; hence
it does not make anything <a href="Back%20to%20Basics.html#actions_and_happenings">happen</a>
 in the
environment. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The Self isn't affected by anything that
happens in the body or the rest of the environment - those happenings do not
stick to the Self or alter its characteristics.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The question now is- 'This Shloka states
that the Self does not make anything happen, since it isn't made up of the <a href="Chapter%202.html#satva_rajas_tamas">three qualities</a>

with the environment and a body. Still, the characteristics of the body don't
stick to it. How come?'</span>

and the Self as the <a href="Chapter%2013.html#field_and_knower_of_field">knower of this field</a>

Their distinct characteristics are realized by people with eyes of awareness. </span>

<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
In addition, those who learn about freedom

<p class=MsoNormal >

<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The awareness about the distinctions

In summary, the body is a part of the
environment. It is our field of action, a result of the elements. </span>

<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The knowledge to discriminate between the
Self and the body, along with the <a href="Chapter%2013.html#virtues_amanitvam">virtues required</a>

to achieve freedom from the bonds of the environment were laid out in this
chapter - starting with <a href="Chapter%2013.html#virtues_amanitvam">being without a sense of

<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
With this ability to discriminate the body

free of all limitations, an unbroken expanse of knowledge.</span>
