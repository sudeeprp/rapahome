<h1>Chapter 4</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
As long as a person is associated with the
material world, it isn't possible to stay away from activity - even though he
may seek <a href="Back%20to%20Basics.html#Moksha">liberation</a>
. This was explained by the Lord in
the third chapter. Hence a person needs to be active without being driven by
outcomes. The path of activity is recommended even for a person who is able to
focus on the Self. In particular, a person who is recognized as superior has
special responsibility to stay active in this way.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
In the fourth chapter, the Lord starts by
saying that He imparted this knowledge to the initial beings of this world -
right at the beginning - to uplift everyone. Reinforcing the need to be active,
the Lord demonstrates that such activity has knowledge embedded in it. He
describes the characteristics of such activity and its variety. He goes on to
say that the main point of activity is knowledge. Along the way, he describes
the true nature of His birth.</span>

The Lord says- In the previous chapter, I

you make war. </span>

<a name="manvantara_defn" >
</a>
<span lang=EN-US >
Right at the
beginning of the current manvantara (a period spanning 4,320,000 human years),
I preached this method to Vivasvan. I did that for the benefit of the world- To
enable people to achieve <a href="Back%20to%20Basics.html#Moksha">moksha</a>
, the ultimate goal.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Vivasvan conveyed this to Manu. Manu, in
turn, conveyed it to Ikshvaku. In this way, it was passed on from generation to
generation. It was known by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajarshi">kings
who were sages</a>
.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Though the method has remained unchanged
since ancient times, knowledge of this method was lost due to the weakness of
its listeners. I have taught you this very method in detail. I taught this due
to your friendship, due to your devotion and due to the fact that you
surrendered and approached me.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
It's not possible for anyone other than Me
to know this method and speak about it, since it is knowledge of the highest
order. It is hidden in the Upanishads.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Continuing this conversation, Arjuna now
asks to know the real nature of the Lord's incarnation in its true form.</span>

<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Of course, it can be explained that the
Lord spoke to Vivasvan in some other birth. Great people can remember their
deeds from a previous birth. So, there is no impossibility or contradiction
over here. Moreover, while conversing, it's not that Arjuna was unaware of
Krishna being the Lord of the universe. In fact, Arjuna himself says 'You are
the ultimate creator, the ultimate refuge and the ultimate in purity. You are a
person who is eternal, divine, the ultimate master- this has been told by all
the sages including Narada, Asita, Devala and Vyasa. You have told me the same.'

In Yudhishthira's Rajasuya, Bhishma and

Consider this: The Lord destroys all
troubles and is the abode of all auspicious qualities. He is the controller of
everything and He knows everything. His purpose is always fulfilled and He has everything
He desires. He has now been born among mortals, who are bound to their actions.
Is this birth real? If so, what is the nature of this birth? What constitutes
the body that is born? What's the cause of this birth? When is this birth going
to happen? What's the goal of such a birth?</span>

The
phrases 'gods' and 'other powers' are used to refer to people or forces of
nature that seem to have the power to grant us what we desire. They could be
parents, teachers, natural phenomena, corporate structures or influential
people. Often, we try to please them to achieve what we want.</span>

</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
All people desire to achieve the outcome of
their actions. For this, they worship and adore gods and various powers. In
reality, I am the one who resides in all gods and all powers, the basis for
their existence. I am the one who ultimately enjoys all worship. Yet, nobody
comes to Me by instinct. Why is it so?</span>

Though the Lord is so
easy to grasp, we remain focused on other short-term accomplishments.</span>
</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
That's because in this world of humans, the
accomplishment of action happens very quickly - accomplishments such as gaining
wealth, the birth of a child, or having food.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The phrase 'world of humans' indicates the
material world. People in the material world lack knowledge, since the influence
of their infinite deeds committed over infinite time has not worn out yet. This
lack of knowledge makes them go after results that can be obtained quickly -
results such as comfort, wealth, children and food. For these, they work to
please the various powers. They don't work as prescribed <a href="karmayoga.html#karmayoga">before</a>
 - they
cannot stay without attachment to outcomes and cannot work to worship Me. They
cannot be indifferent to the material world and focused on achieving <a href="Back%20to%20Basics.html#Moksha">moksha</a>
.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Next, He describes the way in which the
obstacles to start <a href="karmayoga.html#karmayoga">working without
attachments</a>
 can be removed.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >

<span lang=EN-US >
Since the link between the Shlokas at
the beginning of this chapter is a bit difficult to follow, let's draw an
outline over here: In Shloka #4, Arjuna asks Krishna about the nature of his
incarnation. Then Krishna replies: 'I retain all My qualities in My
incarnations. My actions are unaffected by the material world. Those who know
Me in this way will attain My qualities. They will surrender to Me and
experience Me as per their expectations. On the other hand, people try to please
the various powers that they perceive, in order to get worldly outcomes. That's
because these outcomes satisfy their desires quickly. In reality, I am the
enjoyer of all worship. People who work without being driven by desire, purely
as worship towards Me are rare. </span>
</i>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<i >
<span lang=EN-US >
What does it mean to perform such
actions? Take My work of creation, for instance- </span>

Activities such as creation don't stick to
Me- They do not bind Me. They are not sponsored by Me either. The diversity of
creation, like the various gods and humans, happens due to the deeds committed
by the created beings - deeds that are virtuous or otherwise. Thus, I'm not the
one who made this variety of creation happen, with the disparity of wisdom
among its various beings.</span>

Conscious beings and material objects are

creation of something. I don't have this attachment. </span>

Bhagavan Parashara says: 'In the act of
creating the world and its variety of different conscious beings, the Lord is
only the cause. The influence of past deeds is the instrument behind this variety
and inequality. Other than the cause, the conscious being doesn't expect
anything else. The conscious being is driven by the strength of its own deeds,
committed in the material world since ancient times </span>

<p class=MsoNormal >
<i >
<span lang=EN-US >
The essence of these references follows-</span>
</i>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The Lord just initiates the creation of
this variety of conscious beings. The reason for differentiation among various
beings (like gods, humans, animals) is the influence of their past deeds.
Hence, other than the Lord as the ultimate cause of all creation, a conscious
being does not need anything external to obtain various forms. The influence of
its own past deeds is enough to make it assume various forms.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Whoever knows me in this manner is not
bound by his deeds. This person knows Me as the initiator of activities such as
creation. At the same time, he knows that I don't make the result of creation
happen, that I don't have attachment in their results. Such a person is freed
from all obstacles in the way of working without attachments- he will be free
from the influence of past deeds, which cause attachment towards the outcome of
activity.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<i >
<span lang=EN-US >
In summary, the Lord is not merciless or
biased in the creation of varied conscious beings. The act of creation also
does not stick to him as something that He has done. Nothing here contradicts
the fact that He is the Lord of everything and controls everything. It's just
that He does not exercise his control indiscriminately. He permits things to
happen according to the influence of the past deeds of a conscious being.</span>

Awareness of the Self brings the 'freedom
from activity' mentioned here. This is distinct from merely doing our
activities. The Shloka says 'a person sees freedom from activity in action and
sees action in the freedom from activity'- What does this mean?</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
A person sees his own activities take the
form of awareness, when he works with the true nature of the Self. He also sees
this knowledge in the form of activity - since the knowledge of the Self is
embedded in action. He frames every work in the true nature of the Self, accomplishing
both the activity as well as the knowledge to be gained from it.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
In this way, an intelligent person inquires
into the Self with his activities. He knows the entire essence of the
scriptures. He alone has realized everything specified in the scriptures. He
deserves <a href="Back%20to%20Basics.html#Moksha">moksha</a>

<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Here, 'a person' is someone who desires <a href="Back%20to%20Basics.html#Moksha">Moksha</a>
. The phase 'every initiative' includes every
activity, whether it's routine, to gain material items or in pursuit of
interests. Every action is an initiative that is 'separate from desire', done
without attachment towards outcomes. Every action is also 'separate from
expectation'- meaning that such a person performs without equating himself with
the environment and its <a href="Chapter%202.html#satva_rajas_tamas">qualities</a>
, without
focusing on them. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The Self is distinct from the environment.
Awareness of the Self will separate actions from expectations. Awareness of the
Self is like a fire. A wise person who works in this way is said to have
destroyed his past deeds in this fire. This awareness is contained within activities
that aren't driven by desires or expectations. This is the opinion of scholars.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >

In this way, we saw knowledge in activity.
This very fact is elaborated next.</span>

<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The phrase 'without being driven by desire'
is about leaving all attachment towards outcomes. The phrases 'with the mind

are about having only one purpose, which is to realize the Self. In this
purpose, there is no attitude of possessiveness towards the world, or towards
things present in the world.</span>

<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
This person's state of being is described here.
The phrases 'he is satisfied with whatever comes by for the sustenance of the
body' and 'he is beyond the dualities in perception' convey that he tolerates
the inevitable feelings such as heat and cold in this world, till the goal of <a href="Back%20to%20Basics.html#Moksha">moksha</a>
 is reached.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The phrase 'he is free from ill-feelings'
says that he has no ill-feelings towards others. He knows that the cause of any
undesirable <a href="Back%20to%20Basics.html#actions_and_happenings">happening</a>
 lies in his own
deeds.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Lastly, the phrase 'he views both
achievement and non-achievement of results equally' talks about balance. Such a
person has balanced feelings in activities like war, whatever be the outcome
reached - victory or otherwise. This person will not come back to worldly
issues, even while involving in activity, even without <a href="jnanayoga.html#jnAnayOga_a_defn">contemplating

<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
By focusing his mind on the awareness of
the Self, he will lose attachment towards any other subject. He will be free
from all possessions. However, the past has a binding effect. By dedicating his
existence to <a href="Chapter%203.html#yajna">worship</a>
 the Lord with his activity, as
described before, he destroys the effects of his past deeds. None of his past
deeds are retained.</span>

Such activity is associated with a focus on

<p class=MsoNormal >
<i >
<span lang=EN-US >
Every time we work, we intend to make a

to be analogous to making a contribution or offering to the fire.</span>

</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
While making an offering during worship,
the contribution is being offered to the Lord. The ladle that is used to make
the offering is the implement which helps us in our work. By virtue of being a
work of the Lord, it is the same as the Lord. The ladle used in contributing
the offering to the Lord is itself pervaded by the Lord.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
In this way, the contribution, the tool
used in the work, the fire into which the contribution is made and the doer
himself - all these are pervaded by the Lord. In this way, all actions have the
Lord embedded in them.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The person who firmly believes that all
actions are pervaded by the Lord will certainly reach the Lord. He will gain
the knowledge of the Self with the Lord embedded in it - The Self that's pervaded
by the Lord.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
In summary, a person who desires <a href="Back%20to%20Basics.html#Moksha">moksha</a>
 works with the firm belief that every activity is pervaded
by the Lord. With this belief, his activity leads him to realize the true
nature of the Self. This will lead the person to know the Self without needing
an <a href="jnanayoga.html#jnAnayOga_a_defn">exclusive
pursuit of knowledge</a>
.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
In this way, after teaching the knowledge

of working without being driven by outcomes.</span>

Among people who work without being driven
by outcomes, some worship and render service to the Lord. They achieve
excellence through worship alone. Yet others perform by giving offerings in the
sacred fire of the Lord, using implements such as a ladle and offering various
things meant for worship. They achieve excellence by reasoning that 'The Lord
is the contribution' and 'The Lord is the implement'. Their life is about
serving, offering and worshipping the Lord.</span>

Activity can be seen in two faces: One that
is full of material things and another that is full of knowledge. Among these,
the form that is full of knowledge is by far the more significant. Every activity
culminates in knowledge, along with everything else that's included in it.</span>

The Lord continues- I described the Self,
starting with 'Know that the Self is indestructible' (<a href="Chapter%202.html#17">Chapter 2-17</a>), ending with 'This
learning about the knowledge of the Self has been given to you' (<a href="Chapter%202.html#39">Chapter 2-39</a>). By
continuously working with this knowledge, your maturity will progress over
time. Gain clarity on this subject from wise people regularly, in accordance
with the maturity you achieve. Do this by giving yourself to those who know, by
questioning them and by serving them. They will see your intention and teach
the knowledge to you, being inspired by your eagerness to know.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >

Next, He describes this knowledge of the
Self - in its true form, how it would look once it is realized.</span>

<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The Lord tells Arjuna: You are deluded
right now, thinking that your body is your Self and falling for the resultant
feeling of possessiveness. You will not get deluded after knowing the true
nature of the Self.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
With this knowledge, you will see all
beings- including those we call as humans and gods- within your Self. That's
because all beings, when detached from the material environment, have a form
that consists of knowledge alone. That includes you. In this way, all beings
are equivalent. The nature of the Self is always the same when it is freed from
the limitations of associating with the environment. This fact is stated again in
(<a href="Chapter%205.html#19">Chapter 5-19</a>): 'Freed from all these limitations, the Self is equivalent in
nature to the Lord. Hence, they are situated within the Lord'.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
In this way, you will see all beings in Me
without any exception. Due to the fact that the Self in each being is
equivalent in nature to the Lord, it is totally flawless, as said in
(<a href="Chapter%204.html#2">Chapter 4-2</a>): 'Having gained this knowledge, they achieve My characteristics'.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
It is also stated in </span>
<span lang=EN-US style='font-size:8.0pt;line-height:150%' >
[muMDaka upanishad 3-1-3]</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
: 'Having gained this knowledge, a person will give up his good and
bad deeds, become flawless and achieve the ultimate equality'. In this way, the
various scriptures illustrate that the Self, when freed from everything that
has a name, attains a form that's equivalent to the Lord.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
When freed from the material environment,
the Self in every being is alike and equivalent in nature to the Lord.</span>
