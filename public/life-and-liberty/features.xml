Many words in Sanskrit and English have
multiple meanings.
		</text>
		<text> Let's fix an interpretation to frequently encountered words.
		</text>
		<text>
This interpretation may be different from what we're accustomed to.
		</text>
		<text> If you
don't understand even after reading this, don't worry.
		</text>
		<text> Stay in the journey of
inquiry and don't get anxious about answers.
		</text>
		<text>

Who am I?

[Atma] - The Self

As the Lord Himself states, it is not
possible to describe the [Atma]
in speech, nor is it possible to understand it using the intellect.
		</text>
		<text> Needless to
say, the word [Atma] is
difficult to translate.
		</text>
		<text> I have used the word 'Self' with an uppercase 'S' as
the translation of the word [Atma].
		</text>
		<text> 

Rather than thinking about the [Atma] as a ghostly soul, consider it as
being 'me'.
		</text>
		<text> The Self is 'me'.
		</text>
		<text> That brings us to the question 'What am I?' Let's
start by seeing what the Self isn't.
		</text>
		<text>

I am not my body, am I?

Am I a body, a walking bundle of cells and
chemicals, a machine that keeps responding to stimuli? If that's the case, I
would be a different 'me' through my life - the molecules in our body, our
shape, size, even our knowledge and memory - none of them are constant through
the life of the body.
		</text>
		<text> However, I still remain 'me' throughout my life even if
every aspect of my body gets replaced along the way.
		</text>
		<text>

I am not just a
thought, am I?

Let' go a little deeper.
		</text>
		<text> Am I my brain? The
brain is part of the nervous system, which routes all stimuli through its
circuits.
		</text>
		<text> Those circuits are nerve cells insulated from each other by fatty
tissue, connected through gaps in the insulation.
		</text>
		<text> This is known to be the way
memory is built and information is processed.
		</text>
		<text>

There are thoughts in the brain that seem
to run on their own.
		</text>
		<text> They seem to have an existence independent of external
stimuli - something that I hear in my head when I just sit around doing
nothing.
		</text>
		<text> It's the 'chatterbox center'.
		</text>
		<text> Somewhere in the brain, my 'identity' is
located, which could be a 'memory of me'.
		</text>
		<text> It says things like 'I am short,
arrogant, intelligent but lazy' and so on.
		</text>
		<text> Do these centers constitute 'me'?
Does it cause the experience of 'I exist'?

No, these thoughts can change over time
while I remain 'me'.
		</text>
		<text> If I change my identity, maybe become an active person
from a lazy one, do I become a different 'me'? No.
		</text>
		<text> When I grow old and lose
some memory and other mental faculties, 'I' still exist.
		</text>
		<text> The experience of 'I
exist' is perhaps part of what's called 'consciousness'.
		</text>
		<text>

What am I? Let's begin
the discovery of the Self and its relation with the Lord.
		</text>
		<text>

The current state of the art has not
revealed the true nature of our consciousness.
		</text>
		<text> What is consciousness made of?
Does it follow any laws of conservation? Did it exist when the universe was
created? Is it responsible for the awareness and experience of the universe?
Are there different types of consciousness?

Let's use the term 'Self' to refer to that
which gives rise to 'consciousness'.
		</text>
		<text> The Lord begins his conversation with
Arjuna by describing the nature of the Self in the second chapter.
		</text>
		<text> He then
explains the method of realizing it.
		</text>
		<text>

[yOga] - To associate, gain and realize

Yoga is
about realization - a journey to get real.
		</text>
		<text> To associate facts and observations,
gain knowledge and materials required to realize our objective.
		</text>
		<text> We commonly use
the word 'yoga' to mean the postures and activities that go into realizing the
capabilities of our body and mind.
		</text>
		<text> This word has a deeper meaning.
		</text>
		<text> 

Yoga is a journey to
discover reality.
		</text>
		<text> Every form of yoga leads to the same discovery.
		</text>
		<text>

Three forms of yoga are seen in the
conversation of the Gita.
		</text>
		<text>

First, the Lord reveals the art of practicing
yoga in all our activities.
		</text>
		<text> It's about realizing that we aren't entitled to any
outcomes, that the Lord is the enjoyer and the purpose of our actions.
		</text>
		<text> This is
reality.
		</text>
		<text> Practicing this reality is called [karmayOga].
		</text>
		<text> 

Second, He describes yoga in our thoughts.
		</text>
		<text> This
is the realization that we are not our body; that the Self exists for the Lord;
that The Lord is all-powerful and acts according to His principles.
		</text>
		<text> This is
real knowledge and its practice is called [jnAnayOga].
		</text>
		<text>

Third, He talks about practicing yoga in
devotion.
		</text>
		<text> It is to adore the Lord and have Him in our thoughts always.
		</text>
		<text> This is
our state of being and our relationship with the Lord.
		</text>
		<text> Such practice is called [bhaktiyOga].
		</text>
		<text>

Yoga - be it postures, the forms described
above, a study of a science or contemplation - each of them is a journey in our
understanding of the material universe, our body as a part of the universe, us
and our relationship with the Lord.
		</text>
		<text> Such understanding comes with equanimity.
		</text>
		<text>

What am I doing?

[karma] - Action, Activity

Our journey in life is
a series of activities.
		</text>
		<text> Is it about 'doing' or 'making it happen'?

The word [karma] is used in many contexts, so let's pick the basic meaning - any activity
and any action we initiate is called [karma].
		</text>
		<text> An 'action' is something we do with an intention.
		</text>
		<text> Activity happens
in the material universe.
		</text>
		<text> We experience outcomes.
		</text>
		<text>

The distinction between actions, activities,
happenings, goals and outcomes can be hazy, so let's clarify with an example -
Let's say I intend to call my friend.
		</text>
		<text> I initiate the action by picking up the
phone and dialing.
		</text>
		<text> The action itself is accomplished by the activities of my
body.
		</text>
		<text> The call is transmitted by electromagnetic waves.
		</text>
		<text> My friend needs to
receive the call.
		</text>
		<text> That's when the call happens.
		</text>
		<text> In this manner, I intend to do
something and initiate an action.
		</text>
		<text> 

Many things need to come together to make
the activity 'happen'.
		</text>
		<text> Only one of them is 'me'.
		</text>
		<text> The belief that I make things
happen is not reality.
		</text>
		<text> You may remark that none of it would happen unless I
initiated the action.
		</text>
		<text> That would be right - I am entitled only to an
independent intention and an initiation of the action.
		</text>
		<text> I don't make the rest of
the story happen, though I can predict what happens in material terms.
		</text>
		<text> What I
cannot predict is the outcome.
		</text>
		<text>

An activity has an outcome that we
experience.
		</text>
		<text> Let's take the example ahead- suppose my friend responds cheerfully
to my call.
		</text>
		<text> Normally I would experience joy.
		</text>
		<text> However, if I were under a lot of
stress, I may feel envy.
		</text>
		<text> Suppose my friend didn't answer my call.
		</text>
		<text> I could get
frustrated.
		</text>
		<text> Or I could simply call later.
		</text>
		<text>

In this way, we initiate an action with
some intention.
		</text>
		<text> After that, things happen, followed by an outcome in the form
of an experience.
		</text>
		<text> [karma] is
the initiation of the activity.
		</text>
		<text> It's not to be mixed up with what actually
happens, or with any outcomes encountered along the way.
		</text>
		<text>

These outcomes and experiences form the
'fruit' of the action, called [karmaphala].
		</text>
		<text> The results that follow my actions can give me joy or sorrow,
depending on my attachment towards the action and its result.
		</text>
		<text> An outcome
doesn't belong to the action - by doing something, I am not entitled to a
particular experience.
		</text>
		<text> If I don't recognize this, I tie my activity to my
experience and will be bound by it.
		</text>
		<text> Such activity wouldn't be liberating
anymore, it would be pretty depressing.
		</text>
		<text>

Why am I doing
it?

If the action doesn't
guarantee an outcome, why should I work, or give my 100% to achieve a goal?

[dharma] - That which uplifts

It is the first word in the Gita and
appears many times in the epic.
		</text>
		<text> Often, it's translated to mean 'righteousness',
which gives the impression that there is always 'one right thing'.
		</text>
		<text> 

That's not always the case.
		</text>
		<text> For instance,
is it right to tolerate the mistakes of our dear ones? Or confront them even at
the cost of friendship? Righteousness is indeed confusing, so Yudhishtira asks
Bhishma at the end of the war- 'Which [dharma] do you consider superior?' - implying many righteous behaviors.
		</text>
		<text> 

Consider [dharma] as a purpose that uplifts you.
		</text>
		<text> Usually, such an 'uplifting' would liberate
you to see an even higher purpose.
		</text>
		<text> For instance, let's say you set out to earn
money and achieve your goal legally.
		</text>
		<text> This may liberate you to pursue your interests,
or it may open opportunities to make even more money.
		</text>
		<text> Which [dharma] you pick is your choice.
		</text>
		<text>

This brings us to the distinction between
goals, means, purpose, expectation and outcomes.
		</text>
		<text> 

Let's take an example - the activity of
cooking.
		</text>
		<text> The 'goal' is 'what' you're making - a meal, in this case.
		</text>
		<text> The 'means'
is 'how' you're making it, including the utensils, recipe, and items that go
into making the meal.
		</text>
		<text> The 'purpose' says 'why' you're doing it.
		</text>
		<text> 

The purpose of cooking could be to eat, to
feed your family, to feed guests, to earn money, as a duty or just for the love
of cooking.
		</text>
		<text> 

The 'expectation' is linked to desire - it's
what we want for ourselves from the activity.
		</text>
		<text> In this example, while cooking
for the family, we could expect appreciation; we could also expect them to
simply finish the food.
		</text>
		<text> Something happens as an outcome of the activity.
		</text>
		<text> Our
experience of the outcome depends on how we relate it to our expectations.
		</text>
		<text>

In all of this, [dharma] relates to the purpose.
		</text>
		<text> Your purpose 'uplifts' you in varying
degrees- cooking for the love of cooking may be more uplifting than just doing
it for someone else.
		</text>
		<text> On the other hand, if you're doing it for someone whom you
adore, that may be more uplifting than doing it for yourself.
		</text>
		<text>

Look beyond desire.
		</text>
		<text>
Focus on the purpose even when you don't reach the goal you expect.
		</text>
		<text>

With this example, I know the meaning of [dharma] but its application remains shady.
		</text>
		<text>
Do I consider my duty and profession to be above personal relationships? Or
cater to the needs of my dear ones, disregarding rights and opportunity when
they come in the way? What is the purpose of my activities? 

The problem of purpose appears again and
again in the Mahabharata.
		</text>
		<text> The resolution is also consistently stated each time:
Look beyond desires.
		</text>
		<text> Focus on purpose and don't go behind outcomes.
		</text>
		<text> Have the
Lord as your purpose and worship Him.
		</text>
		<text> At this point, there doesn't seem to be a
logical link from the 'problem of purpose' to the 'resolution by worship'.
		</text>
		<text> That's
the journey of the Gita.
		</text>
		<text>

[yajna] - An act of worship

To 'worship' is to 'honor and adore'.
		</text>
		<text> Doing
this consciously means doing it according to a procedure.
		</text>
		<text> Though the word [yajna] is often used to mean 'sacrifice', here
we consider the more general meaning of 'worship'.
		</text>
		<text>

Is there a
different way?

[mOksha] - The
joy of liberation

Moksha is to be free of all limitations.
		</text>
		<text> 

What's it like to be
really free?

We cannot really imagine this state of
being, since we've never been free of all limitations.
		</text>
		<text> To start with, we need
to live with the limitations of our body.
		</text>
		<text> Then there is the limitation that
comes from our desires and attachments - which may come from things we own, the
society, family or friends.
		</text>
		<text> 

All of them are undoubtedly valuable - be
it the body, the society, family or friends.
		</text>
		<text> We cannot accomplish much without
them.
		</text>
		<text> The question is: How many activities do we initiate, expecting to gain or
maintain them? How many activities do we initiate independently, after which
the rest of the story comes together to make it happen?

It isn't necessary to have expectations
whenever we initiate something.
		</text>
		<text> In fact, expectations are limiting in nature.
		</text>
		<text> Take
the activity of singing, for instance.
		</text>
		<text> When I expect appreciation and sing, I
do not feel much liberty in the initiative, being constrained by my impression
of the audience.
		</text>
		<text> Even when I'm appreciated, it's temporary and I need more
appreciation the next time.
		</text>
		<text> It doesn't liberate me in any way.
		</text>
		<text> On the other
hand, if I sing for the joy of singing, it feels more liberating.
		</text>
		<text> There is no
question of failure while I'm enjoying my singing.
		</text>
		<text> Though I may delight in an
activity in this way, repeating the same thing feels boring and my initiative
reduces.
		</text>
		<text> Then, such an initiative is not totally liberating either.
		</text>
		<text>

What if there is a purpose that we're always
meant to achieve? What if any initiative towards that purpose was never to
fail? What if that purpose is easy and always delightful, no matter how many
times it's repeated, no matter how much criticism happens? Being in such a
purpose is the ultimate liberty.
		</text>
		<text> That purpose is the Lord.
		</text>
		<text> Achievement of that
purpose is Moksha.
		</text>
		<text>

Those who are in this purpose are not driven
by the world.
		</text>
		<text>



Let's examine a few more words before we
get started with the Bhagavad-Gita.
		</text>
		<text>

[anAdi kAla] - Beginning-less time


It's the time that transcends the creation
and destruction of the universe.
		</text>
		<text> As opposed to this, the 'normal' time is the
one we experience, which starts with the creation of this universe.
		</text>
		<text>

[vishEShaNa] - Attribute

An attribute is a property that cannot
exist on its own.
		</text>
		<text> For example, 'red color' is an attribute of blood: the
attribute of 'redness' cannot exist on its own: there has to be an object that
shows up as red, for the attribute to exist.
		</text>
		<text> Likewise, we and our universe are
attributes of the Lord.
		</text>
		<text>

[mana:] - The mind 

The mind is an instrument for the Self to
experience this universe.
		</text>
		<text> Understanding, perception, intelligence and cognition
come from the mind.
		</text>
		<text>

[buddhi] - The intellect 

The intellect gives the ability to reason
and distinguish.
		</text>
		<text>

References to the Lord:

All references to the Lord, including
pronouns, start with an uppercase letter.
		</text>
		<text> For example: The Lord said 'I make
Myself come into being by My own will'.
		</text>

strength, force, wealth, valor and radiance.

creation, sustenance and destruction of whole worlds.

		<text> He controls everyone in

people who have taken refuge in Him.

[sanjaya uvAcha] Sanjaya said - [Evam uktvA sankhyE] Having spoken thus on the battlefield, [arjuna:] Arjuna [visr'jya chApam sasharam] put down his bow along with his arrows and [rathOpastha
upAvishat] sat down on the seat of his chariot, [shOka samvigna mAnasa:] being overwhelmed
by sorrow.

In the midst of action,
we sometimes worry 'Am I going to hurt someone? Is the outcome worth it?' 

Sanjaya said
- 

Arjuna is a
person with a great mind.
		</text>
		<text> He is extremely sympathetic and maintains firm bonds
of friendship.
		</text>
		<text> He is righteous and has similar-minded brothers.
		</text>
		<text> He was cheated
by you (Dhritarashtra) many times by terrible acts - such as lodging them in a
house of wax and setting fire to it.
		</text>
		<text> Arjuna has the Lord himself as his support.
		</text>
		<text>
Having seen your people who were to be slain in battle, he was overcome by friendship,
sympathy, fear of righteous and unrighteous behavior.
		</text>
		<text> He lost strength in his
organs and said 'I will never wage war'.
		</text>
		<text> Then, overcome by sadness at the sight
of his relatives to be treated as his opponents, he threw away the bow and
arrow.
		</text>
		<text> He sat on the edge of his chariot.

[ththA] Then, [madhusUdhana:] Krishna [idam vAkyam uvAcha] said this sentence [tam] to Arjuna, [kr`payAviShTam] who was overcome with pity, [ashrupUrNAkulEkShaNam] whose eyes were full of tears: 

[Arjuna] Arjuna, [kuta: idam kashmalam
samupasthitam] why has this confusion come to you [viShamE] at an inappropriate time? [anAryajuShTam] This confusion is not fit
for noble people.
		</text>
		<text> [asvargyam]
It is discomforting [akIrtikaram] and disgraceful.
		</text>
		<text>

[pArtha] Arjuna, [mA sma gama:] don't entertain [klaibyam] such cowardice.
		</text>
		<text> [Etat] It [tvayi na upapadyatE] does not befit you.
		</text>
		<text> [parantapa] You are the one who destroys enemies.
		</text>
		<text> [tyaktvA] Give up [hr`daya daurbalyam] this weakness in your heart [uttiShTha] and rise.
		</text>
		<text>



When Arjuna sat down this way, Lord Krishna
considered - 'Why did this sorrow come at such an inappropriate time?' and said
'Abandon this weakness, which is the property of people without wisdom.
		</text>
		<text> It
results in disgrace and does not help you in any place or situation.
		</text>
		<text> Get up to
fight'.

and fight [bhIShmam droNam cha]
Bhishma and Drona [ishubhi:]

Again, Arjuna is overcome by the haze
between rightfulness and wrongdoing.
		</text>
		<text> His fear arises out of friendship and
pity.

		<text>

He says 'How can I kill teachers like
Bhishma and Drona, who are to be respected in reality? How can I kill them,
even as they are interested in enjoying the kingdom, enjoy the same wealth that
seems to be drenched in their blood? How can I sit on the same seat they had

[bhArata] O
Dhritarashtra, [hr`ShIkEsha:]
Krishna [idam vacha: uvAcha]
spoke the following words [prahasanniva] teasingly [tam] to
Arjuna [sIdamAnam] who was
overcome with grief, [ubhayO: sEnayO: madhyE] situated in the midst of the two armies.

Krishna addresses Arjuna in the next
Shloka.
		</text>
		<text> Arjuna had sunk under sorrow and contradictory feelings.
		</text>
		<text> Such
contradictions come into play when we do not know that the body and the Self
are distinct.
		</text>
		<text> 

Krishna opens his conversation in a manner
meant to tease Arjuna.
		</text>
		<text> He starts with the statement 'There was never a point in
time, when I was not present' two Shlokas hence (Chap.2#12).
		</text>
		<text> He finishes in the
final chapter (Chap.18#66) saying 'I will free you of all sins.
		</text>
		<text> Do not grieve'.
		</text>
		<text>

In between, He describes the real nature of
the Self and the Lord along with the means to realize them: Karmayoga,
Jnanayoga
and Bhaktiyoga.

[tvam] You [anvashOcha:] feel sad [ashOchyAn] for things that you should not
feel sorry about [prajaAvAdAm cha bhAShase] and you speak supposedly enlightened words.
		</text>
		<text> [panDitA:] Learned people [na anushOchanti] do not feel sorry for [gatAsUn] (temporary) bodies [agatAsUn] or the (everlasting) Self



Why do I
hesitate?

The Lord addresses Arjuna- 'You feel sorrow
for things that you don't need to feel sorry about.
		</text>
		<text> You preach about the elders
in the family dying and the ancestors losing their illustrious place
(Chap.1#42).
		</text>
		<text> You say this out of a limited knowledge about the body and the
Self.
		</text>
		<text> 

We don't grieve in such a situation, when
we know the real nature of the body (as temporary) and the Self (as everlasting).
		</text>
		<text>
In the absence of this knowledge, contradictory thoughts arise in you - sorrowful
thoughts like 'Must I kill them' on one side; preaching of duty and doing the
'right' thing on the other.
		</text>
		<text> 

Hesitation happens when
you mix-up the Self with your body and the rest of the environment.
		</text>
		<text>

In reality, a sense of duty and
righteousness follows from the knowledge that the body is distinct from your
Self.
		</text>
		<text> You do not know the real nature of your body, nor do you know about your
Self.
		</text>
		<text> 

The Self is separate from the body and is
ever-lasting.
		</text>
		<text> You don't know that performing duties (such as war) is a method
to realize your Self.
		</text>
		<text> Fighting this war without attachment to its outcome is a
way to realize the true nature of your Self.
		</text>
		<text> 

Your Self does not depend on birth to
exist, nor is it compelled by death to be destroyed.
		</text>
		<text> Your Self does not have
birth and death.
		</text>
		<text> Thus, the Self is not something to feel sorry about.
		</text>
		<text>

Your body is without consciousness and has
an end by its very nature.
		</text>
		<text> It's natural that it is born and that it dies; the
body is also not something to feel sorry about.
		</text>
		<text> That's the opinion of the
Shloka.
		</text>
		<text>

First, listen to the nature of your Self.

The Self is separate
from the environment and your body.
		</text>
		<text> The Self is ever-lasting.
		</text>
		<text> So is the Lord.
		</text>
		<text>

The Lord continues- There has been no time
in the past in which I, the controller of everything, have not existed.
		</text>
		<text> I was
always in existence.
		</text>
		<text> You and all the people you see before you-who are
knowledgeable and skilled in their own fields, are similar.
		</text>
		<text> There has been no
point in time when you did not exist.
		</text>
		<text> You always existed.
		</text>
		<text>

There will be no point of time in the
future as well, in which we will not exist.
		</text>
		<text> We will always exist.
		</text>
		<text>

There is no doubt that I, the Lord of
everything, am ever-existing.
		</text>
		<text> In the same way, there is no doubt that all of
you are ever-existing as well.
		</text>
		<text>

Is there anything other
than the observable universe?

In this Shloka, Krishna is explicit that
all of us exist distinctly.
		</text>
		<text> He also makes it clear that there is something to
us, other than our body.
		</text>
		<text> 

This is not as obvious as it sounds,
when we ask ourselves who we are.
		</text>
		<text> Our body is put together from atoms that are
part of the universe.
		</text>
		<text> In time, every atom in our body would be exchanged.
		</text>
		<text> So,
everything just seems to be a part of the physical universe, where distinctions
like 'you' and 'me' are not real and purely made for convenience.
		</text>
		<text> Within such a
belief, our consciousness seems to be an imaginary concept in the physical
universe.
		</text>
		<text> 

Is the universe only an
effect of the law governing it? 

It is improbable that the organized
complexity of the universe came into being on its own.
		</text>
		<text> There must be a supreme
law that keeps the order in the universe - a law from which all other laws are
derived.
		</text>
		<text> This law would be knowledge and everything else would be its
manifestation.
		</text>
		<text> 

As an example, the law of gravitation
deals with the attraction between two masses.
		</text>
		<text> It is just knowledge.
		</text>
		<text> The earth's
revolution or something falling on the ground are its manifestations, they
aren't really different forces.
		</text>
		<text> 

Likewise, the supreme law that governs
the whole universe would be knowledge and the rest of the universe - including
us - would just be its manifestations.
		</text>
		<text> Again, distinctions like 'you' and 'me'
wouldn't be real.
		</text>
		<text> Our observation of the physical universe is insufficient to
determine this reality - the supreme law must allow us to find it, since it
governs everything in the universe.
		</text>
		<text>

Let's be free of doubt
in our journey to realization

Krishna is the supreme law.
		</text>
		<text> In this Shloka,
He states that we are distinct.
		</text>
		<text> He also states that we have always been present
and will always be - though we see that everything in the universe keeps
integrating and disintegrating.
		</text>
		<text> 

This brings a fresh set of questions -
Since Krishna is supreme, He has full control over us, so we are a part of Him
and are completely under His control.
		</text>
		<text> Why should we suffer the consequences of
our actions, since none of those actions are 'ours'? What are we? 

This is where Krishna startsto
clarify - starting with this Shloka, concluding in Chap.18#66.
		</text>
		<text> To grasp this
clarity in a coherent way, we must have no doubt about the fact that we are
distinct from the Lord and distinct among ourselves - though we may not know
what exactly we are.
		</text>
		<text> 

In the following commentary,
Ramanujacharya picks up alternate interpretations of Krishna's clarification in
this Shloka and knocks them off, so we are left with no doubt in our journey to
grasp and embrace His teaching.
		</text>
		<text>

We are distinct from
the Lord.
		</text>
		<text> Each of us is distinct as well.
		</text>
		<text>

Thus, the Lord, as the owner of everything,
is distinct from others, who are themselves distinct from one another - The
Lord Himself has stated this fact in the Shloka.
		</text>
		<text> While clarifying to Arjuna,
the Lord uses the phrases 'I', 'you', 'all these people' and 'we'.
		</text>
		<text> The opinion
that they are actually the same and only appear to be separate due to some
reason is incorrect - the distinction has been clarified by the Lord.
		</text>
		<text> 

The distinction clarified by the Lord is
also stated in the scriptures as a natural way of being:

In the [shvEtAshvatara], 6-13 and [kaThOpaniahat], 5-14, it is said: 'The Lord is the One
permanent, conscious being who grants the wishes of the many permanent,
conscious beings'.
		</text>
		<text>

Is there any
possibility that the distinctions are a figment of our imagination?

What if these distinctions are imaginary
and we believe them to be real, due to ignorance? This doesn't hold - The Lord
is supreme and these are His statements.
		</text>
		<text> If the Lord were to be the only real
entity without any attributes, unchanged and permanent, ignorance doesn't
happen.
		</text>
		<text> 

So, the Lord's statement that we are many
and are distinct from the Lord couldn't have been made in ignorance.
		</text>
		<text> 

What if knowledge and ignorance coexist in
the Lord, who remains unaffected by that ignorance? The analogy given to
illustrate this possibility is that of a burnt piece of cloth or paper, left
undisturbed.
		</text>
		<text> Though it may have retained its shape, it doesn't have its
original function.
		</text>
		<text> However, this doesn't hold either.
		</text>
		<text> For example, a mirage
makes the illusion of water.
		</text>
		<text> 

However, once we know that a mirage can do
that, we will not reach out to fetch water from it orinitiate any action
based upon such an illusion again.
		</text>
		<text> In the same way, if all distinctions were
due to ignorance and such ignorance was resolved, there wouldn't be a situation
in which the Lord would explain these distinctions to Arjuna.
		</text>
		<text> 

There's no possibility of the Lord being
under the influence of ignorance at some point in the past, as mentioned in the
scriptures:

[mundakOpanishat], 1-2-6 says: He is aware of everything and knows everything.
		</text>
		<text>

[shvEtAshvatara], 6-8 says: The Lord's strength is described in many ways.
		</text>
		<text> Such strength
is His by nature, along with knowledge, strength and His activities.
		</text>
		<text> 

In Chap.7#26, the Lord says: I know the
beings whose time has passed, who are present now and those who will be in the
future.
		</text>
		<text> However, there isn't anyone who knows Me.
		</text>
		<text>

If indeed the Lord is the only one and the
rest are imaginary, the Lord would know that and so would the people He
teaches.
		</text>
		<text> Then whom will the Lord teach that there is only one? Everyone else
would be imaginary.
		</text>
		<text>

What if there is only one and it appears
multiple - like reflections? Arjuna, receiving the teaching, is like a
reflection of the Lord.
		</text>
		<text> Any sane person wouldn't look at his own reflection on
a shining surface and clarify these distinctions to it.
		</text>
		<text>

What if the Lord has the knowledge and is
still limited by past ignorance? That doesn't hold either, let's see why.
		</text>
		<text> 

Having knowledge and still being limited
can be illustrated with an analogy - Suppose there is someone who sees two
moons due to a defect in his vision.
		</text>
		<text> Even after he knows that there's only one
moon, he can still see two moons.
		</text>
		<text> However, the defect in his sight doesn't
cause any harm anymore.
		</text>
		<text> 

This analogy doesn't hold in case of
Krishna.
		</text>
		<text> There's no possibility of any defect returning.
		</text>
		<text> If at all a teacher
has the complete knowledge that there is indeed a single Lord and nothing else
is real, there's no possibility for him to explain anything to anyone - because
they don't exist.
		</text>
		<text> If the teacher doesn't have such complete knowledge,he
cannot teach anyway.
		</text>
		<text> If the teacher is imaginary, then his teachings are also
imaginary.
		</text>
		<text> If the purpose of the teaching was to get rid of ignorance, it
applies to the teachers as well.
		</text>
		<text> If at all these distinctions are due to
ignorance and if the teacher is free of such 'ignorance', whom will he teach?

No, we don't need to
doubt our existence in our journey of realization and worship.
		</text>
		<text>

Considering what Krishna said and the
contradictions that come from alternate interpretations, we are distinct from
the Lord and we are distinct from one another.
		</text>
		<text> This is real, not ignorance.
		</text>
		<text>

Next, the Lord describes what we are.

tathA dEhAntaraprApti: dhIrastatra

]

[yathA] Just as
[dEhina:] the Self, tied in
with a body, experiences [kaumAram] infancy, [yauvvanam] youth, [jarA] and
old age [asmin dEhE] in that
body, [tathA] so also [dEhaAntaraprApti:] it obtains another body.
		</text>
		<text>
[dhIra:] A wise and steadfast
person [na muhyati] does not
get carried away [tatra] in
this matter.
		</text>
		<text>



When a person gives up childhood and gets
to be a youth in the same body, we reason that the person - his Self - is still
the same and don't grieve that 'the Self is destroyed'.
		</text>
		<text> 

In the same way, when the Self is done with
one body and gets another one, a wise and steadfast person would reason that it
isn't destroyed.
		</text>
		<text> Thus, every Self is ever-lasting and it's not something to
grieve about.
		</text>
		<text>

Whenever you are driven
by outcomes, you confuse the Self with the environment.
		</text>
		<text> 

What we must do here is just this.
		</text>
		<text> The
ever-lasting Self is under the influence of actions it has committed -
activities driven by outcomes, performed since beginning-less time.
		</text>
		<text> It gets
associated with a body due to such influence, which is in-line with those actions.
		</text>
		<text>
The Self is liberated from entrapment in such bodies by doing activities suited
to its body, as prescribed by the Lord - without being driven by outcomes.
		</text>
		<text> 

Even while working without being driven by outcomes,
the organs of its body contact their stimuli - as always.
		</text>
		<text> This results in
feelings such as warmth and cold, triggering experiences of comfort or
discomfort.
		</text>
		<text> They must be endured till our duty is done.
		</text>
		<text>

This is elaborated in the following Shloka:

[kauntEya] O
son of Kunti, [bhArata] born in
the Bharata clan, [mAtrAsparshA: tu] contact with the material world [shItOShNa
sukha du:khadA:] gives rise to feelings of cold, heat,
joy and sorrow.
		</text>
		<text> [AgamApAyina:]
They come and go.
		</text>
		<text> [anityA:]
They are temporary.
		</text>
		<text> [tAn titikShasva] Endure them with patience.
		</text>
		<text>



Touch, sound, form, taste and smell - all of
them lie in the primary elements of matter.
		</text>
		<text> This matter causes many experiences
within you, when it comes into contact with your organs.
		</text>
		<text> Organs that sense
events such as touch and sound give us feelings of cold, heat, hardness,
softness and so on.
		</text>
		<text> These feelings in turn lead to experiences of joy and
sorrow.
		</text>
		<text> Words like 'cold', 'heat', 'joy' and 'sorrow' are used as examples to
illustrate all your different experiences.
		</text>
		<text>

Tolerate your
experiences.
		</text>
		<text> They are effects of past activities that were driven by outcomes.
		</text>
		<text>

Till your duties (such as war) are over,
tolerate these experiences with courage and patience.
		</text>
		<text> Since they come and go,
they are definitely tolerable by the courageous who are patient.
		</text>
		<text> They are
indeed temporary: Your experience of the material world is an effect of your
past deeds.
		</text>
		<text> Such effect binds you to the experience.
		</text>
		<text> As soon as the effect gets
spent, the experience disappears.
		</text>
		<text> That's the meaning of the Shloka.
		</text>
		<text>

Next, the Lord explains the purpose of
tolerating these experiences -

[puruSharShabha] O best among men, [yam puruSham] the person whom [EtE] these feelings of sorrow and joy [na
vyathayanti] do not drain, [samadu:kha
sukham] who views sorrow and joy equally, [dhIram] who is wise and steadfast - [sa:] such a person [amr`tatvAya
kalpatE] is fit to attain liberation from downfall.
		</text>
		<text>



Liberation, also known as moksha, is to be
free of everything that binds us.
		</text>
		<text> It is to realize the true nature of our Self
and its complete and utter dependence on the Lord.
		</text>
		<text> It is a state of eternal
knowledge and infinite joy.
		</text>
		<text>

Do your duties to
attain liberation.
		</text>
		<text> Then those experiences do not drain you.
		</text>
		<text>

A wise and steadfast person treats the
unavoidable sorrows of life on par with joy.
		</text>
		<text> He performs duties such as war without
yearning for outcomes.
		</text>
		<text> He does it for liberation.
		</text>
		<text> The various experiences
associated with duty do not affect or drain such a person.
		</text>
		<text> He alone will get
liberation from downfalls- Not men like you who cannot tolerate this sorrow.
		</text>
		<text> In
summary, the Self is eternal and all you need to do is work for liberation.
		</text>
		<text>

The Lord described the eternal nature of
the Self and the temporary nature of the body, giving assurance that there is
no need to grieve.
		</text>
		<text> Next, He elaborates the statement made before (in Chap.2#11)
- 'Wise people do not grieve for the Self or the body':

[asata:] The
body [na vidyatE] does not have
[bhAva:] a stable form.
		</text>
		<text> [sata:] The Self [na
vidyatE] does not have [abhAva:] an unstable or perishing nature.
		</text>
		<text> [anta:] The distinction [ubhayO: api anayO:] between the two of them [dr`ShTa:] has been realized [tatvadarShibhi:] by those who know and can show reality as it is.
		</text>
		<text>



How is the Self
different?

The body, which is never constant, does not
have a stable form.
		</text>
		<text> The Self, which is unchanging, is not subject to
instability.
		</text>
		<text> Leaders who show the path have realized the true nature of the
body and the Self.
		</text>
		<text> The distinction between the body and the Self is realized by
knowing their true nature.
		</text>
		<text> The word [anta] in this Shloka refers to such distinction.
		</text>
		<text>

The body has no consciousness.
		</text>
		<text> It has
instability and change as its very nature.
		</text>
		<text> The Self, having consciousness, has
stability in its nature - this is the meaning here.
		</text>
		<text> Unstable things are, by
nature, subject to destruction.
		</text>
		<text> Stable things do not get destroyed.
		</text>
		<text>

The Self is pure and
unbounded knowledge.
		</text>
		<text> It has been that way and will always remain so.
		</text>
		<text>

Here are references from other scriptures
that state the same: 

[vishNu
purANa],
2-12-43: Sri Parashara has said thus- 'The Self is the
embodiment of knowledge.
		</text>
		<text> Anything other than that is not permanent.
		</text>
		<text>'

[vishNu
purANa], 2-12-45: 'Thus the Self, whose form is constituted by knowledge, is said to
be true and unchanging.
		</text>
		<text> Other things do not have a true form.
		</text>
		<text> This way, the
true nature of the Self has been told to you by me'

[vishNu
purANa], 2-14-24: 'The indestructible Self is indeed the ultimate goal to be
achieved - Thus say the enlightened people.
		</text>
		<text> All inanimate objects are made up
of things that are destructible; hence they are bound to be destroyed.
		</text>
		<text> There is
no doubt here'

[vishNu
purANa], 2-13-100: 'Even over the ages, it does not obtain different forms, which are
normally caused by the usual cause-and-effect occurrences.
		</text>
		<text> What is such a
thing?' (Indicates that it's nothing that's visible to the senses)

Even in the Gita, it is said in Chap.2#18: 'these
bodies are destructible'; in Chap.2#17: 'know that the Self is indestructible'.
		</text>
		<text>
The term [sattva] is used for
the Self and [asattva] for the
body.
		</text>
		<text> This Shloka doesn't touch upon the performance of good deeds - the word [sat] does not indicate goodness here,
though it is one of its meanings.
		</text>
		<text>

The purpose of describing the destructible
and indestructible nature of the body and the Self is to eradicate any confusion
in recognizing them.
		</text>
		<text> 

It was said in Chap.2#11: 'Wise people do
not feel sorry for temporary bodies or the everlasting Self'.
		</text>
		<text> How can we know
the everlasting nature of the Self?

		<text> [na kashchit] Nothing [kartum arhati] is capable of [vinAsham] destroying [avyayasya asya] the indestructible Self



Know without any doubt, that the Self is
indestructible.
		</text>
		<text>

The Self is
indestructible because it is subtle.
		</text>
		<text> It's not made up of anything else.
		</text>
		<text>

The Self is conscious.
		</text>
		<text> It pervades all the
other stuff that lacks consciousness.
		</text>
		<text> Know that this 'Self' is indestructible.
		</text>
		<text> Since
it pervades everything, it is extremely subtle.
		</text>
		<text> It cannot be destroyed by
anything, due to its pervasiveness.
		</text>
		<text> 

Things other than the Self are gross.
		</text>
		<text>
Things that cause destruction, such as weapons, water, fire and air overwhelm
only those things that can be destroyed and achieve their decomposition.
		</text>
		<text>

For example, a hammer can destroy something
when it strikes with speed.
		</text>
		<text> It shatters an object by generating shock and
vibration within the object.
		</text>
		<text> It cannot destroy anything subtle, since there is
no material to shatter.
		</text>
		<text> An example of something that's subtle is
space- it cannot be destroyed in the way we would destroy an object.
		</text>
		<text> 

In this way, the Self is indestructible due
to its subtle nature.
		</text>
		<text>

The following Shloka teaches that our
bodies are destructible by their very nature.

anAshina: apramEyasya tasmAt

]

[ime dEhA:]
These bodies [antavanta: ukta:]
are said to have an ending.
		</text>
		<text> [sharIriNa:] They belong to their Selves, [nityasya
anAshina:] which are ever-lasting, [apramEyasya] which cannot be grasped by the
sense organs.
		</text>
		<text>



All our bodies have an end.
		</text>
		<text> Destruction is
in their nature.
		</text>
		<text>

Take a material thing like a pot, for
example.
		</text>
		<text> A pot is composed of various different elements.
		</text>
		<text> Due to this, it wears
out and is eventually seen to perish.
		</text>
		<text> 

The body is a collection of the five
elements - air, energy, earth, water and space.
		</text>
		<text> The body exists to let the
everlasting Self experience the outcomes of activities.
		</text>
		<text> These experiences
happen according to the specifications listed in the scriptures, such as
'virtue results from virtuous deeds' ([brihadAraNyaka upanishad], 4-4-5).
		</text>
		<text> The body perishes after the effects of the activities are
spent.
		</text>
		<text>

The Self is never destroyed.
		</text>
		<text> Since the Self
is not gross, it cannot be grasped by our sense organs.
		</text>
		<text> The Self is not available
to experience, as our sense organs are only capable of sensing gross things.
		</text>
		<text> The
Self is in the form of subtle knowledge.
		</text>
		<text> 

The Self brings
awareness - the power to experience and know.
		</text>
		<text>

In Chap.13#1, it is said 'Whoever knows
this, is said to know the body as the field of action'.
		</text>
		<text> Moreover, the Self is
not made up of other things.
		</text>
		<text> It is experienced everywhere in the body as 'I
know'.
		</text>
		<text> It's experienced as the knowledge of the body itself and other things-
as a single, subtle form.
		</text>
		<text>

The subtle Self is not like the body and
other material things.
		</text>
		<text> Material things differ in form at different points in
space.
		</text>
		<text> 

Thus, the Self is ever-lasting by virtue of
having a single form, not being subject to change, being the knower and being
pervasive.
		</text>
		<text>

In contrast, the body is a collection of
other elements and is subject to growth and deformation.
		</text>
		<text> It is created only for
the Self to experience the outcome of activity.
		</text>
		<text> It takes on multiple forms.
		</text>
		<text> Due
to these reasons, it is subject to destruction.
		</text>
		<text> The body is pervaded by the
Self.
		</text>
		<text>

The body is subject to destruction by its
very nature.
		</text>
		<text> The Self is by nature everlasting.
		</text>
		<text> Hence, neither is to be grieved
over.
		</text>
		<text> Knowing this, be with courage; bear the inevitable effects of weapons on your
body and on others.
		</text>
		<text> Perform the act of war without expectations regarding the
outcome of your actions, with the intent of gaining freedom from birth and
death (moksha).

[ya:] The one
who [vEtti] knows [Enam] this Self [hantAram] as something which can kill, [yashcha] and the one who [manyatE] assumes that [hatam] it is killed- [ubhau tau] both of them [na vijAnIta:] don't know [nAyam hanti] that the Self does not kill, [na hanyatE] nor can it be killed.
		</text>
		<text>



People who believe that the Self (whose
qualities are described above) can kill, or in any way be a cause for killing, as
well as those who believe that it can be killed due to any cause, do not know.
		</text>
		<text> 

Due to the facts mentioned before, also due
to the fact that the Self is indestructible, it cannot be a cause for killing.
		</text>
		<text>
The Self cannot be killed either, due to the same facts.
		</text>
		<text> 

The verb 'kill' has the Self as the object.
		</text>
		<text>
It refers to the act of separating the Self from the body.
		</text>
		<text> The fact expressed
is that the Self cannot be killed.
		</text>
		<text> In that case, what about the scriptures that
say 'One must not cause harm to animals', 'A student of the scriptures must not
be killed'? These statements forbid certain actions, referring to 'killing' in
the sense of separating the body from the Self.

[ayam] The Self
[kadAchit na jAyatE mriyatE vA]
is not born and never dies [ayam] It [na] has not [bhUtvA] come into being, [bhUya: na bhavitA vA] neither will it ever
cease to be.
		</text>
		<text> [ayam] It is [aja:] without birth, [nitya:] ever-existing, [shAshwata:] everlasting in a single form, [purANa:] existing fresh from the beginning-less
past.
		</text>
		<text> [na hanyatE] The Self is
not killed [sharIrE hanyamAnE]
in a body that inevitably gets dead.
		</text>
		<text>



Due to the reasons mentioned above, the
Self is indestructible.
		</text>
		<text> It isn't subjected to the effects of nature and is not
subject to birth and death.
		</text>
		<text> Birth and death are natural to inanimate objects-
that's the message conveyed in the Shloka.
		</text>
		<text> 

'It is born, it will die': While birth and
death are experienced all the time in bodies belonging to each one of us, they do
not touch the Self at any time.
		</text>
		<text> The concepts of coming into being and ceasing
to exist do not apply to the Self.
		</text>
		<text>

It means the Self has not come into being
at the time of creation (at the beginning of the kalpa),
nor will it cease to exist at the time of destruction.
		</text>
		<text> Brahma, the principal
engineer of the universe, is born and will eventually die.
		</text>
		<text> So do all the other
great powers.
		</text>
		<text> Even in them, birth and death do not affect the Self.
		</text>
		<text> 

In this way, the Self in each body is
without birth.
		</text>
		<text> It is everlasting, doesn't get destroyed and isn't related to
the unending series of cause-effect changes in the environment.
		</text>
		<text> Though ancient,
the Self still seems to be new.
		</text>
		<text> It is experienced as though it had no past -
this is the meaning expressed here.
		</text>
		<text> Thus, the Self is not killed inside the
body that perishes.
		</text>
		<text>

The
beginning of time as we know it starts at the time of creation.
		</text>
		<text> The
'beginning-less time' spans across cycles of creation and destruction.
		</text>
		<text> In this
way, it has no beginning.

[pArtha] Arjuna,
[ya:] whoever [vEda] knows [Enam] the Self [avinAshinam] as being indestructible, [ajam] without birth, [avyayam] without change in form [nityam] and everlasting, [katham] how can [sa: puruSha:] such a person [kam ghAtayati] hurt anyone [kam hanti] or kill anyone?



The Self is indestructible, being without
birth and without wearing out.
		</text>
		<text> How can anyone with this awareness hurt any
body's Self? Or kill and destroy anyone? How can he even be the initiator of
the killing? - That is the message here.
		</text>
		<text> The feeling of sadness, such as 'I
will hurt the Self within them, I will kill them' - is caused by ignorance of
the real nature of the Self.
		</text>
		<text> That is the assertion here.
		</text>
		<text>

This gives rise to a doubt - Even when we
know that death is merely the separation of the Self from the body, isn't the
disintegration of the body something to grieve about? After all, the body is a
medium to enjoy the good things in life.
		</text>
		<text> When the Self discards its body, isn't
it a sorrowful event? This doubt is addressed in the next Shloka.

The Self owns different
bodies over time.
		</text>
		<text> It remains unchanged even as the body keeps changing.
		</text>
		<text>

People who give up the body while
performing their duty of war will obtain a new body, which is superior to the
one they sacrificed.

		<text> This is known from the scriptures, just as discarding
worn-out clothes and wearing new ones is an occasion of joy indeed.

Again, the statement made before in
Chap.2#17: 'Know that the one, by which all this is pervaded, is indestructible'

being indestructible is strengthened here.

[ayam] This
Self [avyakta:] cannot be
distinguished by experiences of the sense organs.
		</text>
		<text> [ayam
achintya:] It cannot be realized via any thought
process.
		</text>
		<text> [ayam avikArya: uchyatE] It is said to be of unchanging form.
		</text>
		<text> [tasmAt] Thus, [Enam viditvA] knowing this fact, [anushOchitum na arhasi] you don't need to feel any sorrow for the Self.
		</text>
		<text>



The Self is not experienced with the kind
of 'proof of existence', using which we experience sensory objects.
		</text>
		<text> Unlike
material objects, the Self cannot be split into parts either.
		</text>
		<text> It cannot be
understood in terms of things that we can sense.
		</text>
		<text> 

The Self is distinct from all the objects
we experience.
		</text>
		<text> The Self cannot be deduced by thought either: Since it is
distinct from everything we experience, we cannot think about it in terms of any
material characteristics.
		</text>
		<text> The Self is not subject to any change of form.
		</text>
		<text>

With the knowledge of the Self as explained
above, you don't need to feel sorrow for it.

[atha cha] In
an other way, [manyasE] if you
assume that [Enam] the Self [nityajAtam] is something that's always
subject to birth, [vA] or [manyasE] you assume that [nityam mr'tam] it's something that is

On the other hand, let's suppose you didn't

		<text> Let's
say you believe the body to be your Self, recycled across births and deaths as
a part of the environment.
		</text>
		<text> Even then it is inappropriate to feel so much
sorrow.
		</text>

Creation and destruction are inevitable for
the body, since it is subject to the effects of the environment by its very
nature.

]

[mr`tyu: dhruvO hi] Just as death is definite [jAtasya] for one who is born, [dhruvam janma] birth (in another form) is definite [mr`tasya
cha] for one who is dead.
		</text>
		<text> [tasmAt] Hence, [aparihAryE arthE] this inevitable phenomenon [tvam shOchitum
na arhasi] does not qualify as something for you to
feel sorry about.
		</text>
		<text>



The destruction of anything that's born is
certain - This inevitability is evident.
		</text>
		<text> 

Also, it is inevitable that something that
has been destroyed comes into existence.
		</text>
		<text> How is it possible, that something
that has been destroyed is born again? 

To answer the question, consider this: For
things that are perceived to exist, their creation is evident.
		</text>
		<text> For things that
don't seem to exist, it's not evident.
		</text>
		<text> Terms like creation and destruction
describe different states of an object that has existence.
		</text>
		<text> 

As an analogy, things that do exist, such
as threads, when put together, form something that's called cloth.
		</text>
		<text> The same
thing applies even to things that don't seem to exist - The thread changed its
context, it did not cease to exist.
		</text>
		<text>

When things like clothes are created,
nothing else is observed, except that threads are put together in a pattern.
		</text>
		<text>
Merely by a transaction, or by using a different name, or by using it for a
different purpose, the thought that new matter has been created is not
appropriate.
		</text>
		<text> Thus, things like creation and destruction are different states of
an existing object.
		</text>
		<text> 

'Destruction' is said to happen when an
object, which is in the state called 'created', obtains a state that seems
opposite to its created state.
		</text>
		<text> For example, mud can exist in different states
such as 'dough-like-mass', as a 'pot', as 'pieces' and as 'powder'.
		</text>
		<text> 

In the same manner, any object that's
affected by its environment inevitably undergoes a series of transformations.
		</text>
		<text>
For an object that exists in a certain state, obtaining the next state is its
destruction.
		</text>
		<text> For the object in the succeeding state, obtaining that state itself
is its creation.
		</text>
		<text> Thus, it's inevitable that any object that's affected by its
environment undergoes a series of creations and destructions: There is no need
to feel sorry about this.
		</text>
		<text>

Even the slightest sorrow that may arise on
seeing an object change from one state to another does not arise in the case of
humans and other beings - The Lord states that next.

[bhArata] Arjuna,
[bhUtAni] living beings [avyaktAdIni] are previously in a state that
cannot be perceived.
		</text>
		<text> [vyaktamadhyAni] In-between, they can be perceived.

		<text> [avyakta
nidhanAnyEva] After death, they cannot be perceived
anyway.
		</text>
		<text> [kA paridEvanA] What's
the sorrow [tatra] over there?



Living beings such as humans are not
perceived in their previous state, before birth.
		</text>
		<text> They are perceived to exist as
'human' in the 'middle' states and are not perceivable in their succeeding
state after death.
		</text>
		<text> They will exist as per their nature.
		</text>
		<text> Hence, there is no
cause for sorrow.
		</text>
		<text> Even in the argument that the body and the Self are
identical, there is no cause for sorrow.
		</text>
		<text> 

The Lord explained the amazing nature of
the Self and clarified that it's distinct from the body.
		</text>
		<text> Next, He says that it's
rare to find someone with definite knowledge of the Self, who talks about it,
listens and is in line with the listening.

Shloka illustrates three ways of experiencing the Self - seeing, speaking and

[bhArata] Arjuna,
[ayam dEhI] this Self, which is
the owner of the body [nityam avadhya:] is ever indestructible [sarvasya dEhE] inside every body.
		</text>
		<text> [tasmAt] Hence, [tvam] you [na arhasi] don't need [shOchitum] to feel sad [sarvaNi] about all [bhUtAni] beings.

It should be learnt that the Self owns the
body, is situated inside the body and is never killed, even though everyone's
body perishes.
		</text>
		<text> That holds even for the bodies of gods.
		</text>
		<text> 

Thus, the nature of the Self in all beings
is the same and everlasting due to the characteristics mentioned above.
		</text>
		<text> It
doesn't matter if those beings have different forms, be they gods or just stationary organisms.
		</text>
		<text> Any differences
in form and other temporary characteristics relate to the body alone.

		<text> Hence,
you don't need to feel sad regarding any of the beings, including the Gods.

		</text>
		<text> [shr`Nu] Listen [imAm] to
this teaching [yOgE] in the
form of actions that are done for the purpose of attaining moksha.
		</text>
		<text>



The word [sankhyA] means 'intellect' - the capability to reason logically.
		</text>
		<text> The method
to realize the Self through the intellect is called [sAnkhyA] over here.
		</text>
		<text> 

The teaching required to get the nature of
the Self has been given to you, starting from (Chap.2#12): 'There was never a
point in time, when I was not present' and ending with (Chap.2#30): 'Hence, you
do not need to feel sad regarding any of the beings'.
		</text>
		<text> The word [yOga] in this Shloka refers to the work we
do with the knowledge of the Self.
		</text>
		<text> Such work is a predecessor to the
realization of the Self.
		</text>
		<text> It acts as a means to achieve moksha.
		</text>
		<text>


Outcomes of our actions
do not matter when we're aware of the Self.
		</text>
		<text>

In one of the following Shlokas
(Chap.2#49), it is said-'Ordinary action that's driven by desire is far
inferior to actions that are done with the knowledge of the Self.
		</text>
		<text> That's [buddhiyOga], the technique of working with
the knowledge of the Self for the purpose of attaining moksha,
without attachment towards the outcome'.
		</text>
		<text> 

Now, listen to the knowledge required in
applying this technique.
		</text>
		<text> With this knowledge, you shall free yourself by your
actions.
		</text>
		<text> This means freedom from the bonds and limitations of this world that inhibit
you.

		<text>

The Shlokas following the next one impart
knowledge required to carry out action that leads to moksha.

Even if an action that has begun is
terminated without being complete, it's still not useless.
		</text>
		<text> In this termination,
there is no element of blame either.
		</text>
		<text>

When outcomes don't
matter, we can't do anything wrong.
		</text>
		<text>

The conduct of working without attachment
is called [karmayOga].
		</text>
		<text>
Even a small amount of this conduct shall save you from great fear- the fear
arising out of attachment to various things in this world.
		</text>
		<text> 

This opinion has also been stated in one of
the following Shlokas (Chap.6#40): 'There is no destruction for this, either
now or in the future'.
		</text>
		<text> On the other hand, actions that are attached to worldly,
material goals do not yield fruit if abandoned in the middle.
		</text>
		<text> Moreover,
abandoning such actions also incurs blame.
		</text>
		<text>

Some of our intentions make us do things to
achieve our material desires.
		</text>
		<text> On the other hand, there is the intention to
achieve liberation, which makes us work towards that
goal.
		</text>
		<text> In the next Shloka, Krishna explains that the intention to achieve liberation is superior to thoughts that go into satisfying
other desires.

bahushAkhA hyanantAshcha
buddhayO_vyavasAyinAm || 41 ||
		</text>
		<text>

]

[kurunandana] Arjuna,
[iha] here, [buddhi:] the intention [vyavasAyAtmikA] that perseveres to
determine the nature of the Self [EkA hi] is indeed one.
		</text>
		<text> [avyavasAyinAm] Those that do not have such determination [bahushAkhA:] are of many types [anantA: cha] and innumerable.
		</text>
		<text>



The Lord says 'Here, the intention that perseveres
to determine the nature of the Self is indeed one'.
		</text>
		<text> The word 'here' refers to
the entire field of conscious activities.
		</text>
		<text> In this field, He says 'the intention
that perseveres to determine the nature of the Self is indeed one'- meaning, the
intention of a person who works to attain moksha is an intent
that has determination.
		</text>
		<text> The determination is to ascertain the true nature of
the Self.
		</text>
		<text> 

On the other hand, actions that are driven
by desires are without such resolve.
		</text>
		<text> When we are driven by desires, it's just
beneficial to know the distinction between the body and the Self.
		</text>
		<text> It's not
necessary to realize the true nature of the Self.
		</text>
		<text> Even without ascertaining the
real nature of the Self, it's possible to ask for desirable things, achieve
them and enjoy them- there is nothing to oppose this.
		</text>
		<text>

The 'focused intention to achieve
liberation' is said to be 'one', by virtue of having a single goal.
		</text>
		<text> A person
who has the determination to achieve liberation would initiate all activity for
the one end-result called moksha.
		</text>
		<text> Hence, given the same wisdom
behind these activities, there is a single intent that drives all the actions.
		</text>
		<text> 

As an analogy, take the intention to make
money for the sake of money itself.
		</text>
		<text> There may be many different activities that
can make money.
		</text>
		<text> The wisdom driving those activities is the practical awareness
of capital.
		</text>
		<text> The intention behind all those activities is the same.
		</text>
		<text>

People without the determination to achieve
liberation are ruled by actions to achieve various outcomes, such as children,
wealth, food or a place in heaven.
		</text>
		<text> Due to the countless variety of outcomes,
the intentions that drive those actions are uncountable as well.
		</text>
		<text> Also, they
branch out variously in the form of differences and side-effect within the same
goal.
		</text>
		<text> Hence, the intentions of people who do not have such determination have
many branches and are countless.
		</text>
		<text>

It doesn't really
matter what drives your action; Do it for the Lord.
		</text>
		<text>

This is the summary: Give up all outcomes
that are said to be obtained from daily activities.
		</text>
		<text> Involve in all activity
with the same wisdom - the practical awareness that work is done for the sake
of the Lord.
		</text>
		<text> Have moksha as the only goal.
		</text>
		<text> Even in case
of actions driven by desire, done in accordance with your occupation, give up
the outcomes associated with them.
		</text>
		<text> They are to be done according to your
capability along with your daily activities, for the purpose of attaining moksha.
		</text>
		<text>

In the next three Shlokas, the Lord
criticizes those who perform desire-driven activities with attachment towards their
outcomes.

[pArtha] Arjuna, [avipashchita:] people who know a little, [vEdavAdaratA:] who give importance to statements in the Vedas dealing with
desire-driven actions, [nAnyadastIti vAdina:] who say there is nothing else, [kAmAtmAna:] who indulge in their desires, [svargaparA:] who consider heaven as the ultimate goal - [puShpitAm
vAcham pravadanti] such people speak in flowery language
[janma karma phala pradAm kriyAvishEShabahulAm] about diverse and unfocussed activities that are supposed to give
various outcomes like the birth of a child, [bhOgaishvarya
gatim prati] with the goal as enjoyment and material wealth.
		</text>
		<text>


[vyavasAyAtmikA buddhi:] The intention to determine the nature of the Self [samAdhau na vidhIyatE] is not present in
the minds [tayA apahr`ta chEtasAm] of those who are carried away by such speech, [bhOgaishvarya prasaktAnAm] who are
interested in enjoyment and wealth.
		</text>
		<text>



There are people who speak about results in
life.
		</text>
		<text> Their words are like flowers, beautiful on the outside.
		</text>
		<text> They have certain
characteristics: They know a little and speak about paths that bring about
enjoyment and wealth; they are interested in those parts of the Vedas that deal
with enjoyment; due to their attachment towards enjoyment, they say nothing
else exists.
		</text>
		<text> They indulge in their desires, and are driven by them.
		</text>
		<text> They think enjoyment
is the ultimate goal.
		</text>
		<text> 

After experiencing the high life, they
again experience birth and commit various actions - this is where their ideas
will lead.
		</text>
		<text> Due to ignorance, they preach activities that aim to beget enjoyment
and wealth.
		</text>
		<text>

There are people who are misled by all this.
		</text>
		<text>
Their mind is abducted by such preaching and they end up indulging in enjoyment
and wealth.
		</text>
		<text> The intention to determine the true nature of the Self is absent in
such people.
		</text>
		<text> Their minds will never have the knowledge required for carrying
out actions that lead to moksha- actions which lead to
the true nature of the Self.
		</text>
		<text>

Hence, a person who desires moksha must not associate with desire-driven actions.
		</text>
		<text>

Now, some questions arise: The Vedas deal
with the science of your Self with an affection that's greater than thousands
of parents.
		</text>
		<text> Why is it that the Vedas also preach actions that yield minor enjoyments,
which further the cycle of re-birth? Is it appropriate to say that the outcomes
prescribed in the Vedas are to be given up? Answers to these questions come in
the following Shlokas:

]

[arjuna] Arjuna, [vEdA:] the
Vedas [traiguNya viShayA:] deal
with those who have the three
qualities in abundance.
		</text>
		<text> [nistraiguNyO
bhava] Be a person who is not drowned by an excess of
these three qualities.
		</text>
		<text> [nirdvandva:] Be free from the dualities of the material world.
		</text>
		<text> [nitya sattvastha:] Be constantly situated
in an abundance of the quality of sattva.
		</text>
		<text> [niryOgakShEma:]
Do not care about protecting what you have and don't bother to acquire what you
don't.
		</text>
		<text> [AtmavAn] Know the
nature of your Self.
		</text>
		<text>



[vijAnata: brAhmaNasya] A man of wisdom seeking God [yAvAnartha:
tAvAn] will find as much use [sarvEShu
vEdEShu] in all the Vedas, [yAvAn
artha: tAvAn] as one will find use [udapAnE] in a lake, [sarvata: samplutOdakE] that is full of
water in every respect.
		</text>
		<text>



Three
qualities influence all things that are created: sattva
(wisdom, virtue, truth), rajas (passion, emotion: cause of
great activity) and tamas (ignorance, darkness).
		</text>
		<text> 

Some of us are associated with abundant
amounts of these three qualities.
		</text>
		<text> The Vedas deal with this subject: With great
compassion, they preach activities that are suitable for those of us with a prominent
influence of ignorance (tamas), for those in whom passion
(rajas) is prominent and for those in whom wisdom and
virtue (sattva) are prominent.
		</text>
		<text> 

In case the Vedas did not preach the means
to achieve goals suitable to our nature, we would get turned away from moksha, which is the goal of people with wisdom (sattva).
		</text>
		<text> We get turned away due to the influence of passion
and ignorance (rajas and tamas).
		</text>
		<text> When
passion and ignorance get a hold on us, we wouldn't know what's appropriate to
achieve our desires and would become helpless.
		</text>
		<text> We would be overcome by
confusion as to what has to be attained and what not.
		</text>
		<text> 

That's why the Vedas deal with all the
above qualities.
		</text>
		<text>

However, do not be a person influenced by
all the three qualities.
		</text>
		<text> You are now
situated in wisdom (sattva).
		</text>
		<text> Keep progressing in the same
way.
		</text>
		<text> Do not allow a mix of the three qualities control you.
		</text>
		<text> 'Be free from
dualities' by donning an attitude of disregard for all material things,
standing in wisdom (sattva) always, not being influenced
by the other two qualities.
		</text>
		<text> 

The world is full of
passion and ignorance.
		</text>
		<text> Don't let them control you.
		</text>
		<text>

What is the way to achieve this? Let go of
the urge to acquire things that don't contribute to the realization of the
Self.
		</text>
		<text> Let go of protecting what you have acquired.
		</text>
		<text> Be someone who is interested
in the quest to find the true nature of the Self.
		</text>
		<text> 

When you conduct yourself this way, you
will rid yourself of the powerful influence of passion and ignorance (rajas and tamas) and your wisdom
(sattva) will grow.
		</text>
		<text>

Also, everything said in the Vedas is not
applicable to everyone.
		</text>
		<text> A thirsty person can only drink so much water from a
lake as he needs.
		</text>
		<text> Even though the lake is full of water, it was built with many
purposes in mind.
		</text>
		<text> Just as a person will not drink the whole lake, a person
desiring moksha will only take the part that helps him
attain moksha, not the entire content of the Vedas.
		</text>
		<text>

In the next Shloka, The Lord says that only
so much can apply to a person desiring moksha, who is situated
in the property of wisdom (sattva):

You have authority [karmaNi Eva] only in action, [mA phalEShu kadAchana] never in the outcome of those actions.

actions.

		<text> [mA tE sanga: astu]
May you not be attached [akarmaNi] to inaction.
		</text>
		<text>



The word
'hEtu' is translated to 'the reason for'.
		</text>
		<text> The 'reason for' something is in two
ways: As the cause, or as a motive or purpose.
		</text>
		<text> Both ways hold here: Outcomes of
actions don't happen for your purpose.
		</text>
		<text> You aren't the only cause behind them
either.
		</text>
		<text>

You have the authority
to initiate activity.
		</text>
		<text> You are not the one who makes things happen.
		</text>
		<text>

Your authority lies in action alone.
		</text>
		<text> Actions
could be routine activities that you do daily, or work done to achieve your desires.
		</text>
		<text>
Always be situated in the property of wisdom (sattva) and
have a longing for moksha.
		</text>
		<text> Never do you have authority
over the outcome associated with actions.
		</text>
		<text> 

Everything we do while expecting a desired outcome
is binding in nature.
		</text>
		<text> Actions done without expectation for outcomes, which are
done as a way to worship Me are liberating.
		</text>
		<text> They will support you in achieving moksha.
		</text>
		<text> Do not consider yourself to be the cause of the outcome of your actions.
		</text>
		<text>

While you yearn for liberty,
you are situated in the quality of sattva.
		</text>
		<text> Do not
consider yourself as the one who makes things happen,
even though you initiated the action.
		</text>
		<text> For instance, even in case of simple
activities such as eating, don't consider yourself to be the cause or the
purpose of getting rid of hunger.
		</text>
		<text>

Trust the cause of both actions and outcomes
to be within the three qualities or within Me,
the Lord of everything.
		</text>
		<text> A future Shloka (Chap.3#30) elaborates this.
		</text>
		<text> Apply this
concept and do your work.
		</text>
		<text> 

Do not avoid activity.
		</text>
		<text>

Do not be attracted towards the concept of
not doing anything.
		</text>
		<text> Don't avoid work in the way you said 'I will not fight'
(Chap.2#9).
		</text>
		<text> Always be associated with activity in the manner described.

Involve in activities like this war while
being situated in yoga.

		<text> Give up attachment towards the kingdom, your relatives and
other things.
		</text>
		<text> Consider success - like a victory in battle and any failure in achievement
as being equal.
		</text>
		<text> 

Here, the consideration that success and
failure are equal is called yoga.
		</text>
		<text> Yoga is impassioned thought.
		</text>
		<text> When you

[dhananjaya] Arjuna,
[karma] ordinary, desire-driven
actions [dUrENa hi avaram] are
highly inferior to [buddhiyOgAt] actions done with the knowledge of the Self, without attachment to
outcomes.
		</text>
		<text> [sharaNam anvichCha]
Take refuge [buddau] in that
knowledge.
		</text>
		<text> [phalahEtava:] Those
who think that they cause the outcomes [kr`paNA:] are to be pitied.
		</text>
		<text>



Performing
with an awareness of the Self is called [buddhiyOga].
		</text>
		<text> It is explained as the awareness that lets us give up the final outcome
of any activity, along with any success or failure experienced before it's
complete.
		</text>
		<text> 

When compared to such activities, others
are by far inferior.
		</text>
		<text> The two types of activities are indeed very distinct.
		</text>
		<text> When
you are aware of the Self while working, you get rid of all misfortune present
in the material world.
		</text>
		<text> This path leads to moksha, the
ultimate goal.
		</text>
		<text> 

The other kind of action (driven by desire)
will result in the same material world, leading to sorrow.
		</text>
		<text> Hence, take refuge
in the knowledge of the Self while performing your actions: Trust and be
situated in the awareness of the Self.
		</text>
		<text> 

'Those who think that they cause the outcomes
are to be pitied': Those who work while being attached to its outcome will
remain in the material world - they are to be pitied.

		<text>

Why
know the Self?

The word [kaushalam] also means skillfulness.

done with the knowledge of the Self are the most skillful among all actions'

Working with an
awareness of the Self brings out the best in us - the skill in our actions.

By working while being aware of the Self, a
person is freed from the influence of endless rights and wrongs collected since

Among all actions that are to be done, those
that are done with the awareness of the Self are the best.

As said before, do your work with the

		<text> Ignorance is something
that gets you addicted to the limited gratification given by sensual pleasures.

		<text>
It prevents you from discerning the truth.
		</text>
		<text> This ignorance is caused by
attachments towards minor material outcomes.

When your intellect crosses over this
ignorance, you will gain complete indifference to material outcomes.

After being taught in this way, Arjuna asks
about the characteristic of being firm in wisdom- a state in which we are free
from confusion.
		</text>
		<text> It comes from performing actions without attachments and leads
to the realization of the Self.
		</text>
		<text> He also asks about the conduct of a person who
is firm in wisdom.
		</text>
		<text>

Being
'firm in wisdom' is to be engaged in an inquiry into the Self, cultivating true
knowledge.
		</text>
		<text> The term 'firm in wisdom' is used as the translation for [sthitaprajna].
		</text>
		<text> Other ways of translating
the word [sthitaprajna]
are: 'one whose consciousness is fully realized', 'one whose consciousness is
steadfast', 'one who is free from confusion'.
		</text>
		<text> It's about giving up all the
ignorance surrounding the Self and being free from all confusion.

[arjuna uvAcha]
Arjuna said- [kEshava] 'O
Krishna, [bhAShA kA] what words
can be used for the description [sthitaprajnasya] of a person who stands firm in wisdom, [smAdhisthasya] who has attained control over his mind? [sthitadhI:] Being unmoved, [kim prabhAShEta] what does he speak? [kim] How does he [AsIta]
be? [kim vrajEta] What does he
do?'



To describe someone standing firm in wisdom is to realize the characteristics
of that person.
		</text>
		<text> What does such a person do, what does he speak, how does he
behave?

While describing this person's special
state of being, the Lord explains the qualities of such a person and the way to
get there.

[shrI bhagavAn uvAcha] Lord Krishna said- [pArtha] Arjuna, [AtmanA]
with the mind [tuShTa:] being
content [Atmani Eva] in the
Self alone, [yadA] when [prajahAti] a person gives up [sarvAn kAmAn] all desires [manOgatAn] that enter the mind, [tadA] then, [sthitaprajna:

		</text>
		<text>



An experience of the
Self is so pleasant that likes and dislikes don't matter anymore.
		</text>
		<text>

'The mind
being content in the Self alone' - In this state, the mind is joyful in the
presence of the Self alone.
		</text>
		<text> With that joy, it totally gives up all other
desires that come its way.
		</text>
		<text> It is said to be firm
in wisdom, having achieved the highest state of knowledge.
		</text>
		<text>

Next, the Lord describes the nature of a
person who is one step behind the one who has attained the highest state of
knowledge.
		</text>
		<text> Not that far behind, though.

fear [krOdha:] and anger- [muni:] Such a sage [uchyatE] is said to be [sthitadhI:] situated firm

This person is not agitated and saddened
when he is separated from something he likes.
		</text>
		<text> He is free from attachment even
when he is with the things he likes.
		</text>
		<text> 

He has let go of emotions, fear and anger: Desire
takes control when we develop attachment towards something we do not have.
		</text>
		<text> Fear
is the anticipation of losing our dear possessions or contacting something we
dislike.
		</text>
		<text> Anger is a distortion in the mind that causes sorrow in another
being, who is perceived to be the cause of undesirable things.

The person who has let go of these three

[nAbhinandati]
A person is neither driven by likes [na dvEShTi] nor by dislikes [ya:] when he is [anabhisnEha:] without attachment [sarvatra] in all respects, [prApya] even on obtaining [tattat shubhAshubham] things that he likes or dislikes.

This person is neutral and objective even

happenings - such as the happiness on gaining something favorable or the sadness
that accompanies a loss.

its limbs, [yadA] when [ayam] this person [samharatE] takes away [indriyANi] his sense organs [indriyArthEbhya:] from all their indulgences, [tasya prajnA] his consciousness [prathiShThitA] is steadfast.
		</text>

Even as the sense organs desire to indulge
in things that are sensed by them, a person who pulls them back - like a
tortoise pulling its limbs within - steadies his mind upon his Self and is also
situated firm in wisdom.
		</text>
		<text> 

Thus, there are four types of people who are
engaged in cultivating true knowledge.
		</text>
		<text> This engagement can be achieved
progressively, as illustrated in the verses above.

Now, the Lord says that staying engaged in this

[rasavarjam]
With the exception of desire, [viShayA:] sensual objects [vinivartantE] retreat [dEhina:]
from somebody [nirAhArasya] who
has pulled his sense organs back from those objects.

Sense-organs experience sensual objects.
		</text>
		<text> Someone
who retracts his sense organs from sensual objects will see those experiences
retreating from him - that includes all experiences that can retreat.
		</text>
		<text> The
desire for sensory objects is an exception.
		</text>
		<text> It remains without retreating.

Even this desire retreats upon seeing the

[kauntEya] Arjuna,
[api] even if [vipashcita:] a person who knows this [yatata:] tries hard, [puruShasya] his [pramAthIni] powerful [indriyANi] sense organs [haranti] will hijack [mana:]
his mind [prasabham] by force.
		</text>
		<text>



Sensory desires won't retreat until we see
the Self.
		</text>
		<text> In the presence of these desires, their powerful influence abducts our
sense organs by force.
		</text>
		<text> This happens even in those who have all the required
knowledge and want to be engaged in realizing the Self.
		</text>
		<text>

Thus, mastery over the sense organs depends
on realizing the Self.
		</text>
		<text> Realizing the Self requires mastery over the sense
organs.
		</text>
		<text> In this cycle, obtaining the ultimate knowledge about the Self is very
tough.

balances [tAni sarvANi] all of

		</text>
		<text> [indriyANi yasya vashE hi] Only a person with
control over his sense organs [tasya prajnA
pratiShThitA] has steadfast consciousness.
		</text>
		<text>



The person who wishes to get out of the
cycle must control his sense organs - which is a difficult thing to do, due to
his desire for sensual objects.
		</text>
		<text> He must focus his mind on Me and be content.
		</text>
		<text> 

I am a very favorable refuge for all
conscious beings.
		</text>
		<text> All flaws in the mind are cleared entirely when it indulges
in My thought.
		</text>
		<text> Thus purified, the mind gets free of its desire for sensual
objects and brings the sense organs under its control.
		</text>
		<text> 

In this way, a mind gains control over the
sense organs and qualifies to realize the Self.
		</text>
		<text> As said in the [vishnupurAna], 6-7-74: 'Like a bright fire combines with the wind to burn down dry wood,
Vishnu is situated in your consciousness and destroys all the flaws of His
devotees'

This Shloka concludes with the statement- 'Only
a person with control over his sense organs has steadfast
consciousness'.
		</text>
		<text>

It isn't possible to
experience the Self without placing ourselves in the refuge of the Lord.
		</text>
		<text>

In the next two Shlokas, the Lord says that
without placing the mind in Him, a person who tries to control his sense organs
on his own will see his efforts end in vain.

		</text>
		<text> [praNashyati] The person is wasted, [buddhinAshAt] once his intellect is gone.
		</text>
		<text>



A person who does not focus his mind on Me
wouldn't have lost his desire for sensual objects yet.
		</text>
		<text> Even when he controls
his sense organs, he will definitely indulge in thoughts about sensual objects.
		</text>
		<text>
This indulgence comes from the influence of infinite actions.
		</text>
		<text> He has committed
these actions since beginning-less time, all the while being driven by the desire
for outcomes.
		</text>
		<text>

When he indulges in thoughts about sensory
objects, he will grow a strong attachment towards them again.
		</text>
		<text> From that
attachment, desire is born - the ripening of attachment is called desire.
		</text>
		<text>
Desire is a state in which a person is unable to stay without experiencing
things that stimulate the sense organs.
		</text>
		<text> 

From this desire, anger is born.
		</text>
		<text> There will
be a time when a person is denied something he desires.
		</text>
		<text> Then, he feels that
others are responsible and throws his anger at them.
		</text>
		<text> It's a feeling like 'Due
to them, I don't have what I like'.
		</text>
		<text>

Anger results in delusion- being insensitive
to what must be done and what must not.
		</text>
		<text> Due to this delusion, a person may do
anything at all - the awareness involved in controlling his sense organs and
other activities is lost.
		</text>
		<text> Due to loss of such understanding, the intellect
perishes.
		</text>
		<text> 

The focus that he brought about to gain
realization of the Self is destroyed.

		<text> Due to the loss of such intellect, he
falls back to material things and is wasted.

]

[pArtha] Arjuna,
[EShA] this is [brAhmI sthiti:] a state, which leads you to
realize your Self.
		</text>
		<text> [na vimuhyati] You will not get carried away by material things [Enam prApya] after attaining this state.
		</text>
		<text> [asyAm sthitvA] If a person is in this state
[antakAlE_pi] even at his final
moment, [r`chChati] he realizes
[nirvANam brahma] the Self,
full of joy.
		</text>
		<text>



The 'state of being' in which you work
without attachment is the foundation for gaining eternal knowledge of the Self.
		</text>
		<text>
This state of being is a property of the person who is free of confusion.
		</text>
		<text> 

You will not get carried away by material
things after attaining this state of being, performing actions without
attachment.
		</text>
		<text> Even if you achieve this state at the end of your lifetime, you will
attain the Self.
		</text>
		<text> You will realize the Self as having joy itself as its
characteristic.
		</text>
		<text>

Thus, in the second chapter, Arjuna was
taught the knowledge of the eternal Self.
		</text>
		<text> Before this, he did not know the real
nature of the Self.
		</text>
		<text> He also didn't know that action in war can achieve the
realization of the Self.
		</text>
		<text> With the misconception that the body is the Self, he was
about to withdraw from the war.
		</text>
		<text> 

As a foundation to gain knowledge and get
rid of the misconception, Lord Krishna taught him the technique of Karmayoga-
performing actions without attachment.
		</text>
		<text> It is a means to achieve freedom from confusion.
		</text>
		<text>

In summary: To resolve Arjuna's confusion,
the second chapter described the knowledge required to realize the eternal Self.
		</text>
		<text>
It also gives the knowledge required to work without attachments.
		</text>
		<text> The aim of
this knowledge is to be firm in wisdom.

		<text>Chapter
3

The Lord is the goal of those who seek liberation.
		</text>
		<text> The Lord has been described as a repository of
an infinite amount of endless virtues, repelling every kind of misfortune.
		</text>
		<text>
Attaining the Lord is all about supreme devotion, variously called by terms
such as worship and meditation.
		</text>
		<text> 

The Lord has been described as 'The Self
that relieves every Self of its misfortune' in [ChAndOgya], 8-7-1.
		</text>
		<text> 

In fact, working without being driven, achieving
supreme skill in our work, realizing the Self, its relation to the Lord,
devotion to the Lord and attaining the Lord are equivalent - they are presented
as a sequence.
		</text>
		<text> 

The nature of the Self is beyond the states
of being awake, asleep or in deep sleep.
		</text>
		<text> It was stated that the Self does not
have a form that we can perceive.
		</text>
		<text> [ChAndOgya], 8-12-2 states that it shines
brightly in its own form.
		</text>
		<text> It is said in the [kaThOpanishat] as well: In the quest to realize the Self, a person will worship
the Lord, get to know Him and will break free of happiness and sorrow.
		</text>
		<text> 

The content of the previous chapter is also
stated in the [kaThOpanishat]: The Self is not born and doesn't die.
		</text>
		<text> It is subtle even in
comparison to the most fundamental particle.
		</text>
		<text> The wise person knows it to be
great and limitless, so he doesn't worry.
		</text>
		<text> 

The [kaThOpanishat] also says- this Self is not attained by speaking about it, by
thinking about it or even by hearing its characteristics repeatedly.
		</text>
		<text> The Self is
attained by the person who has been chosen by the Lord.
		</text>
		<text> It reveals itself to
this person.
		</text>
		<text> The Lord chooses those who choose the Lord.
		</text>
		<text> This is devotion.
		</text>
		<text> 

 [kaThOpanishat], 1-3-9 says- The
person who has knowledge as the guiding force and keeps his mind under control
will attain great heights and reach the Lord's abode.
		</text>
		<text>

In the next four chapters, the Lord talks
about realizing the Self and the methods to achieve that realization.

[janardana] O Krishna, [tE matA chEt] if in your opinion, [buddhi:] the use of knowledge to perform without desire [jyAyasE] is better than [karmaNa:] ordinary actions, [tat kim] then why [niyOjayasi
mAm] do you urge me [ghOrE
karmaNi] to be involved in gruesome acts?

[vyAmishrENaiva] With contradictory [vAkyEna] statements, [mOhayasIva] it seems to me, that you are deluding [mE

		</text>
		<text> [tat] Hence, [Ekam vada]
tell me one thing, [yEna] by
which [shrEya: ApnuyAm] I can
attain excellence [nishchitya]
definitely.
		</text>
		<text>



Arjuna asks
Lord Krishna:

If your opinion is that knowledge is better
than action, why are you urging me to perform these gruesome actions? Let's
elaborate Arjuna's question:

Should I employ my
organs in activity? Or pull them back?

On one hand, it was told
that focused meditation is the means to realizing the Self.
		</text>
		<text> Proficiency in working
without being driven by desire is the means to achieve this focus.
		</text>
		<text> 

On the other hand, the advice was
to avoid the indulgence of our organs and the mind in sensory perceptions
such as touch and sound.
		</text>
		<text> This was the means to achieve the knowledge required
to realize the Self.
		</text>
		<text>

If indeed, ceasing the indulgence of the
sense organs is the way to realize the Self, then I would focus only on
meditation.
		</text>
		<text> That would be the way to get rid of the effects of all my past
actions.
		</text>
		<text> Why do you urge me to perform gruesome deeds that involve indulgence
of all the sense organs, which works against the realization of the Self? 

It feels like I am deluded by mixed and
contradictory statements.
		</text>
		<text> On the one hand, I need to stop indulging in sensual
perceptions to gain knowledge about the Self.
		</text>
		<text> On the other hand, the directive
to work is opposite to that.
		</text>
		<text> This is a mixed message.
		</text>
		<text> Hence, tell me one
statement that is not mixed- implementing which I will certainly attain
excellence.
		</text>
		<text>

		</text>
		<text>

]

[shrI bhagavAn uvAcha] The Lord said-

[anagha] Flawless Arjuna, [asmin lOkE] in this world, [dvividhA niShThA] there are two types of practices.
		</text>
		<text> [purA
prOktA mayA] I have said this long ago.
		</text>
		<text> [sAnkhyAnAm] For people who want to reason
out the knowledge of the Self, [jnAnayOgEna] it's via contemplation.
		</text>
		<text> [yOginAm] For
diligent people, [karmayOgEna]
it's via accomplishing deeds without being driven by desire.
		</text>
		<text>



Lord Krishna says- You have not grasped
what was said before.
		</text>
		<text> What I said before is that the world is full of different
people, who are entitled to different things.
		</text>
		<text> I described the two types of
practices- knowledge and action- without any mix-up: These two practices are to
be followed by people who are qualified to perform them.
		</text>
		<text> Indeed, not everyone who
desires moksha is directly qualified to pursue the knowledge
of the Self.
		</text>
		<text> 

However, everyone is definitely entitled to
work without attachments, doing it as My service.
		</text>
		<text> They get rid of their flaws
by performing such actions.
		</text>
		<text> Their organs lose all their agitation.
		</text>
		<text> Then, they qualify
to realize the Self.
		</text>
		<text>

You reach the goal by
being active and offering your activity as service to the Lord.
		</text>
		<text>

It is said in Chap.18#46: 'Any human being
attains the goal by worshipping the Lord with his own work - The Lord, by whom
all this is pervaded, from whom all beings get their ability to commence action'

In this way, it is explained that actions
done just as a service to the Lord will lead us to our goal of moksha.
		</text>
		<text>
In the previous chapter, Chap.2#47 said 'You have the authority only in action'-
Working without being driven by desire moves our intellect beyond the delusions
and desires arising from association with material objects.
		</text>
		<text> 

Focusing your thought
without being affected by this world is another way to achieve the goal.
		</text>
		<text>

The characteristics of a person who is
standing firm in wisdom are described starting
in Chap.2#55: 'When a person gives up all desires that enter the mind, then, he
is said to be standing firm in wisdom'.
		</text>
		<text> The technique of contemplation was described.
		</text>
		<text> This
technique is called [jnAnayOga].
		</text>
		<text>
It is for people who can reason out the knowledge of the Self through their
intellect alone.
		</text>
		<text> People with such focused intellect are called [sAnkhyA:].
		</text>
		<text> The word [sankhyA] means intellect.
		</text>
		<text> These people can
focus on the knowledge of the Self alone without wavering.
		</text>
		<text>

In summary: People are always entitled to
do their work without being driven by desire - even people whose intellect is still
turned by material objects.
		</text>
		<text> Others whose intellect remains unaffected are qualified
to contemplate using that intellect.
		</text>
		<text> Both of them are different paths to
achieve moksha.
		</text>
		<text>

Thus, nothing contradictory or mixed-up was
said.
		</text>
		<text>

The next Shloka says that the exclusive practice
of contemplation is very difficult for all people - even those in whom the desire
for moksha has taken birth.

[karmaNAm anArambhAt] By avoiding the initiation of actions, [puruSha:] A person [na ashnutE] will not attain [naiShkarmyam] freedom from the influence of his deeds.
		</text>
		<text> [saMnyasanAt
Eva cha] Moreover, just by renunciation of the actions
he has begun, [na samadhigachChati] one does not attain [siddhim] the goal of moksha.
		</text>
		<text>



If you just avoid initiating the work that
you need to do, you do not attain freedom from the influence of your deeds-
meaning, you wouldn't qualify to focus your thought on the Self.
		</text>
		<text> You wouldn't qualify
by abandoning the activity that you've started, either.
		</text>
		<text> 

Liberation is achieved by performing
actions as worship to the Supreme Lord, without being driven by desire for outcomes.
		</text>
		<text>


Without such actions, you will not reach
the goal of moksha.
		</text>
		<text> When you don't worship Lord Govinda
with actions that are free from desire, the influence of your activity shackles
you.
		</text>
		<text> These shackles accumulate indefinitely over time.
		</text>
		<text> You would not let go of your
flaws, you wouldn't rid your organs of agitation and you would not qualify to focus
your thought on the Self.
		</text>
		<text>

This idea is elaborated in the next Shloka:

[na kashchit]
Nobody [tiShThati] can stay [akarmakr`t] without performing any action [kShaNamapi jAtu] even for a moment, [hi] indeed.
		</text>
		<text> [sarva:] Everyone [avasha:]
is compelled [kAryatE] to
perform [karma] actions [prakr'tijai: guNai:] due to the qualities
born out of worldly matter.
		</text>
		<text>



You cannot exist in
this world without activity.
		</text>
		<text>

Indeed, no person in this world can stay
without doing something, even for a moment, even if the person decides not to
do anything.
		</text>
		<text> Everyone is driven towards activity - this is inevitable.
		</text>
		<text>

Such activity is in-line with the qualities
of sattva, rajas and tamas that you possess.
		</text>
		<text>
These qualities arise from worldly matter.
		</text>
		<text> Each quality is nurtured according
to the actions committed by you since your eternal past.
		</text>
		<text> 

Thus, by working without being driven by
the desire for outcomes- as explained before- you are freed from the influence
of past deeds.
		</text>
		<text> You bring the qualities of sattva,
rajas and tamas under control.
		</text>
		<text> With a pure mind, you are fit to pursue the
Self.
		</text>

Without this, a person who begins the
pursuit of realization would practice in vain-

Ears, skin, eyes, nose, tongue

2.

		<text> [karmEndriya] Organs of work: Hands,
legs, organs of speech and the two excretory organs



Restraint and sacrifice
are pretense when you still yearn for 'what could have been'.
		</text>
		<text>

Without losing the influence of past deeds,
a person wouldn't have conquered his senses and his mind.
		</text>
		<text> When such a person
sets out to realize the Self, he is still drawn towards sensual objects.
		</text>
		<text> He
keeps thinking about those objects and turns away from the Self.
		</text>
		<text> Instead of
realizing the Self, his purpose is diverted in other ways; his actions are also
diverted towards other things.

		<text> 

That's why such a person is said to
practice in vain.

[arjuna] Arjuna,
[tu] on the other hand, [ya:] the one who [ArabhatE] initiates [karmayOgam] actions without attachment [karmEndriyai:] through the organs of work, [asakta:] without being driven by outcomes, [niyamya] controlling [indriyANi] those organs [manasA] with the mind - [sa:] such a person [vishiShyatE] is distinguished and superior.
		</text>
		<text>



Do your activities to
realize your Self - instead of having your attachments agitate you.
		</text>
		<text>

Consider all the work you have been doing
to attain your goals - be they your duties or any other actions.
		</text>
		<text> Do the same
work while controlling your organs with your mind, tending them towards
realizing the Self, without being driven by attachments.
		</text>
		<text> Take those very
organs, which naturally tend towards activity and apply them to work without being
driven by outcomes.
		</text>
		<text> 

Then, it's impossible for you to fall back
to ignorance.
		</text>
		<text> In this way, you are superior to someone who believes in giving
up the world to find the Self.

sharIra yAtrApi cha tE na prasidhyEt

		</text>
		<text>

]

[tvam karma kuru] Do your activity- [niyatam] it is inevitable.
		</text>
		<text> [karma] Activity [jyAya:]
is superior to [akarmaNa:]
inaction.
		</text>
		<text> [api] Even [sharIrayAtrA] the journey through this body
[na prasidhyEt] is not possible
[tE] for you, [akarmaNa:] when you are inactive.
		</text>
		<text>



The word [niyatam] is used here to mean 'invariably accompanied with'.
		</text>
		<text> Everyone who is
associated with matter is invariably accompanied by activity.
		</text>
		<text> Such is the
relation between the person and activity.
		</text>
		<text> Thus, activity is certainly available
to everyone, due to the influence of innumerable actions committed in the past.
		</text>
		<text>
Activity is easy and isn't associated with the danger of ignorance.
		</text>
		<text> Hence,
certainly perform action.
		</text>
		<text> 

The word 'inactivity' is used here to mean
'the mere practice of contemplation without involving our organs in action'-
see (Chap.3#4), where it says 'By avoiding actions, a person cannot get rid of
the influence of his past deeds'.
		</text>
		<text> Definitely, action is better than mere
contemplation on the Self.
		</text>
		<text>

Even for a person who is able to contemplate
on the Self as an intellectual activity, the pursuit is extremely difficult -
that's because he does not have the experience of being inactive.
		</text>
		<text> It isn't
possible to control this method.
		</text>
		<text> This pursuit is also associated with the
danger of falling into ignorance.
		</text>
		<text> 

Hence, being with activity is definitely
better than merely striving for knowledge.
		</text>
		<text>

While imparting the knowledge of the Self
in its true form, it is explained later (Chap.5#14) that the Self is not the
doer when we perform an action - by its very nature, it doesn't make the
outcome happen.
		</text>
		<text> Thus, the knowledge about the true nature of the Self is
included inside actions that are performed without attachment to outcomes.
		</text>
		<text> In
this way, these actions are superior.
		</text>
		<text>

The statement that activity is superior to inaction
holds true indeed, even for a person who is able to focus on the Self.
		</text>
		<text> Suppose this
person were to give up all activity, pursuing the knowledge of the Self alone.
		</text>
		<text> That's
not entirely possible since the practice of contemplation itself happens as an
activity inside his body and that is definitely not inactive.
		</text>
		<text> 

Till the realization of the Self is
complete, you need to be associated with a body.
		</text>
		<text>

Worship the Lord with wealth accumulated
through just means.
		</text>
		<text> Conduct your journey in this life inside your body, with the
balance coming from this worship.
		</text>
		<text> In the [ChAndOgya upanishad] (7-26-2), it is said- 'If what we eat is pure, the content of our body will
be pure.
		</text>
		<text> When the content is pure, our consciousness
is firm'.
		</text>
		<text> Further on, in (Chap.3-13), it is said: 'The person who cooks for
his own sake will suffer guilt'.
		</text>
		<text> 

Thus, even if an intellectual in the
pursuit of the Self wanted to avoid activity, the journey through the life of
his body would be impossible without any activity.
		</text>
		<text> This person needs to perform
worship and other duties, till his goal of realizing the Self is met.
		</text>
		<text>

The realization of the Self comes from working
without being driven by outcomes - by knowing the fact that the Self is not the doer.
		</text>
		<text> The ability to work is
provided readily by nature- it is easily available.
		</text>
		<text> In summary, working without
being driven by outcomes is superior, even for a person who is able to meditate
on the Self as a purely intellectual activity.
		</text>
		<text>

Hence, without doubt, work without being
driven by outcomes.
		</text>
		<text>

Often, our activities
themselves cause agitation, don't they?

Next, a question: If this is indeed so and we
need to be in action, accumulating wealth and so on, the accumulation of wealth
would be associated with the feeling that 'I am the cause' and 'This is mine'.
		</text>
		<text> Such
feelings cause our organs to be agitated and we fall back under the influence
of our past deeds.
		</text>
		<text> Isn't that so? The next Shloka answers this question.

It's true that activity
needs a purpose.

		<text> Make the Lord's worship as your purpose.
		</text>
		<text>

The word 'yajna' is the
procedure of 'worship'.
		</text>
		<text> To worship is 'to adore' and 'revere'.
		</text>
		<text> The Lord is to
be adored and revered by any procedure.
		</text>
		<text> Anything else that is adored and
revered is a part of Him.
		</text>
		<text> Working with such adoration is called 'worship'.
		</text>
		<text>

Work and prosper to worship - this method
makes the Lord as the purpose of all your activities.
		</text>
		<text> As opposed to this,
actions done solely for personal gratification will bind and limit a person in
this world.
		</text>
		<text> 

Hence, work and prosper for the purpose of
worship.
		</text>
		<text> In this process, be free of the attachment that results from doing
things for personal gratification.
		</text>
		<text> When you work to worship the Lord, you are free
from attachment and the Lord is gratified with your actions.
		</text>
		<text> He will free you
from the influence of endless actions committed over time and grant you the
realization of the Self and freedom from agitation.
		</text>
		<text>

The following Shlokas state that you need
to take nourishment from the balance that comes out of worship.
		</text>
		<text> Take care of your
body with such nourishment and achieve your goals.
		</text>
		<text> Nurturing the body with
things other than this balance is a mistake.

		<text> [ESha] May these
forms of worship [astu] be [iShTa kAmadhuk] the fulfiller of your likes
and desires.
		</text>
		<text>



The 'Lord of all beings' here refers to
Narayana, who is the ruler of everything, the cause of the creation of the
universe, who pervades it entirely, who is the supreme abode of all beings.
		</text>
		<text> He
created all beings long ago, at the time of creation.
		</text>
		<text>

At the time of creation, the Lord knew that
many beings were helpless under the influence of their innumerable deeds.
		</text>
		<text> In
the singularity before creation, there was no way to distinguish things with
names.
		</text>
		<text> They were dissolved in the Lord himself and were unable to realize their
goals.
		</text>
		<text> They were as if without consciousness.
		</text>
		<text> 

The compassionate Lord willed to bring them
to life.
		</text>
		<text> He created them along with the forms of worship that are required to adore
the Lord.
		</text>
		<text> He said- 'Prosper and grow with the various forms of worship.
		</text>
		<text>
Let them (the forms of worship) give you the ultimate goal of moksha,
and also satisfy other desires that are supportive to this goal.
		</text>
		<text>'

How does this mechanism work?

Pleased by worship, [dEvA:] the

give [va:] you [iShTAn bhOgAn] the enjoyment you wish for.

'Pleased by worship'- Being adored through
worship performed previously, the gods, in
whom I am present, will give you the enjoyment you wish for- That enjoyment,
which is wished by people who strive for the ultimate goal of moksha.
		</text>
		<text>
They will give you what you expect for the worship you perform.
		</text>
		<text> 

The person who enjoys these objects of
enjoyment for pleasing himself is indeed a thief.
		</text>
		<text> Such a person considers them
his own and avoids giving anything back.
		</text>
		<text> Considering something that belongs to
someone else as our own is called theft.
		</text>
		<text> 

If we keep being possessive about things
that are meant for someone else, we'd be unfit to attain the ultimate goal.

end up suffering guilt as well.

This is elaborated in the following Shloka:

[santa:] Virtuous
people [yajnashiShTAshina:] who
consume the balance that remains from worship [muchyantE] get free of [sarva kilbhiShai:] all faults.
		</text>
		<text> [yO pApA:] The kleptomaniacs who [pachanti] enjoy the outcomes [AtmakAraNAt] for their own sake [tE tu agham bhunjatE] beget nothing but misfortune.
		</text>
		<text>



When you acquire wealth solely for the
worship of the Supreme Lord who pervades the Self in every one, you make the
wealth bear fruit.
		</text>
		<text> You worship the Lord with it and exist in your body using
the balance that remains from worship.
		</text>
		<text> You get freedom from all faults that
you've collected over an infinite period of time, which stop you from realizing
the true nature of your Self.
		</text>
		<text>

Wealth is given by the all-pervading Lord
to perform His worship.
		</text>
		<text> Those who consider it their own and consume it for
their own benefit are kleptomaniacs.
		</text>
		<text> They beget misfortune and are turned away
from realizing the Self.
		</text>
		<text>

Everything
happens for the Lord's worship

In the following Shlokas, the Lord
illustrates that 'worship' is the root of all prosperity in this world, both
from the worldly point of view and from the point of view of the scriptures.
		</text>
		<text> Hence,
He says, it is necessary to perform worship and it's a mistake not to perform
it.

[bhUtAni] Bodies of conscious beings [bhavanti] are made [annAt]
from food.
		</text>
		<text> [anna] Food [sambhava:] is created [parjanyAt] using rain water.
		</text>
		<text> [parjanya:] Rain [bhavati] is a result of [yajna] a method of worship.
		</text>
		<text> [yajna:] Such worship
[samudbhavam] is a result of [karma] activity.
		</text>
		<text> 

[viddhi] Know that [karma]
actions [brahmOdbhavam] result
from the environment.
		</text>
		<text> [brahma akShara samudbhavam] The environment comes alive as your body by virtue of the
indestructible Self.
		</text>
		<text> [tasmAt]
Thus, [sarvagatam] the
ubiquitous [brahma] environment
[nityam pratiShThitam] is
always involved in [yajne] a
method of worship.
		</text>
		<text>

[iha]
Over here, [ya:] the one who [na anuvartayati] does not follow [pravartitam chakram] the continuous cycle [Evam] in this way [aghAyu:] spends a lifetime collecting faults.
		</text>
		<text> [indriyArAma:] He wanders where his sense organs take him [mOgham] and wastes [jIvati]
his life away.
		</text>
		<text>



To comprehend this Shloka, think about all
activities of nature (including your body) as a procedure to worship.
		</text>
		<text> Worship is done to please the Lord.
		</text>
		<text>
The Lord created everything for his own enjoyment.
		</text>
		<text> Hence, anything that happens
in the environment is for His pleasure and is a method of worship - including
sunshine, rain, the growth of food, nourishment and so on.
		</text>
		<text>

All living beings survive by consuming
food.
		</text>
		<text> Food is created using rain water- this fact is known to everyone.
		</text>
		<text> The
fact that rain water is a result of a method of worship is stated in the
scriptures such as [brahma purANa], 16-4: 'The Sun has fuel that burns.
		</text>
		<text> Rain happens due to the Sun'.
		</text>
		<text> 

Activity happens in the
environment, not for our purpose.
		</text>
		<text> The Self must engage in worship.
		</text>
		<text>

Any method of worship results from activity.
		</text>
		<text>
An example of such activity is to earn or acquire materials.
		</text>
		<text> This activity pans
out in a series of transactions involving all
things that make the activity happen.
		</text>
		<text> Activity happens in the environment.
		</text>
		<text> In
this Shloka, the word [brahma]
is used to denote the body, which is a contribution of nature.
		</text>
		<text> Our environment is
an attribute of the Lord, as said in [muMDaka], 1-1-16: 'The environment, along with all things that are distinguishable
in it arise from the Supreme Lord'.
		</text>
		<text> Also, in (Chap.14#3), it is said 'the
entire universe is my womb'.
		</text>
		<text> 

The word [akShara] in this Shloka denotes the Self.
		</text>
		<text> This Self, being satisfied with
food and water, instructs the body to work.
		</text>
		<text> In this way, the body is the
vehicle of activity.
		</text>
		<text> This possibility arises in the presence of the Self.
		</text>
		<text>

In summary, all actions relate to the body
and are enabled by the Self.
		</text>
		<text> The Self must engage in worship.
		</text>
		<text> Worship is the origin
of all actions.
		</text>
		<text> 

The cycle kept in motion by the Lord runs
like this: Bodies of conscious beings comes from food; Food comes due to rain; Rain
results from a method of worship; Worship results from activity, put together
by the transactions of the doers; activity comes from bodies of conscious
beings.
		</text>
		<text> The bodies come from food - This is the cycle, which runs in the form
of a cause-and-effect chain.
		</text>
		<text>

People who do not acknowledge and follow
this cycle while actually being in it earn a lot of guilt.
		</text>
		<text> They don't nurture
their bodies with the residue of worship.
		</text>
		<text> They spend a lifetime gathering and
finding fault.
		</text>
		<text> These people continue to look for contentment in the sense
organs.
		</text>
		<text> They do not look for contentment in the Self.
		</text>
		<text> Sense organs restrict their
field of play.
		</text>
		<text> 

With the body and mind nurtured by things
other than the residue of worship, the properties of rajas
(passion) and tamas (ignorance) are abundant.
		</text>
		<text> They are
turned away from the realization of the Self and immerse themselves in
experiencing material things alone.
		</text>
		<text> This applies to those who are able to contemplate,
as well as to the rest who are eligible to work without being driven by outcomes.
		</text>
		<text>

In this way, they are said to waste away
life without achieving moksha, even while focusing their
thoughts on the Self.
		</text>
		<text>

The next Shloka explains that only a truly
free person isn't bound to initiate any actions.
		</text>
		<text> Such a person can see his Self
without the need to achieve or strive for anything.

[yastu mAnava:] The person who [Atmarati: Eva] is always inclined towards the Self, [Atma
tr`ptashcha] satisfied in the Self alone, [Atmani Eva santuShTa:] and who enjoys being
in the Self alone - [tasya kAryam na vidyatE] he is not bound to perform any actions.

		</text>
		<text>
[asya] To him, [kashchit arthavyapAshraya: naiva]
benefit-driven relationships do not exist.
		</text>
		<text> 

[tasmAt] Hence, [satatam]
always [samAchara] perform [kAryam karma] the actions that must be
done, [asakta:] without being
driven by attachments or addictions.
		</text>
		<text> [Acharan hi] Only by performing [karma] actions [asakta:]
without being driven by attachments, [pUruSha:] a person [param ApnOti] will attain the realization of the Self.
		</text>
		<text>



A person who is focused on the Self need
not do anything special to achieve the Self.
		</text>
		<text> The Self is automatically visible within,
by his own nature.
		</text>
		<text> This person naturally revels in the Self, is inclined
towards the Self and is satisfied by the Self; not by other things like food or
entertainment; he isn't arrogant because he knows the
Self, or because he works
without attachment.
		</text>
		<text> His refuge, nourishment and consumption are all in the
Self alone.
		</text>
		<text>

Due to this, anything done by him for the
purpose of achieving the Self is of no added benefit.
		</text>
		<text> If he stays without doing
anything to achieve the Self, there is no loss- he can see the Self without any
effort or strife.
		</text>
		<text> Being disinterested in anything other than the Self, he does
not have a dependency in the form of 'this is useful to me', towards any
inanimate object.
		</text>
		<text> He does not need to do anything to achieve this independence.
		</text>
		<text>
He is truly free.
		</text>
		<text>

He does not indulge in accomplishments,
since he does not need any accomplishment to realize the Self.
		</text>
		<text> Even for those
who are involved in accomplishing things, the best action is [karmayOga] - working without attachment
towards its outcome.
		</text>
		<text> It's easy to practice, is free of fault and has the
knowledge of the Self embedded in it.
		</text>
		<text>

Due to this reason, keep working without
any attachment until the Self is realized.
		</text>
		<text> Consider your action merely as a
duty - 'something to be done'.
		</text>
		<text> The person who practices this form of action -
without believing that he is the cause of the outcome
- will attain the supreme goal (moksha) and realize the
Self.

Even those who are able to contemplate on

		<text> Due to
this, even great and knowledgeable persons like Janaka chose the path of action

To realize the Self, we saw that a person

intellectually must work without
attachment towards outcomes.

Thus, the champions, famous for their
distinguished learning, must involve in their profession to assure the people

I am the master of everything; My

		<text> Only by my will is the universe born,

		<text> This birth of mine is in the form of a man and is

		<text> I do everything out of my own free will.

		<text>


Even then, as the son of the extremely
virtuous Vasudeva, suppose I am not diligent in activities that fit My clan.
		</text>
		<text> Other
people, who are virtuous but feel incomplete would know Me as the son of a
virtuous person and follow Me.
		</text>
		<text> They would believe whatever I do is right.
		</text>
		<text> They
would not be diligent in performing their duties.
		</text>
		<text> They would default, not
realizing the Self, remaining without achievement.
		</text>
		<text> 

If I don't perform actions according to My
position, virtuous people would perceive that as 'the right thing to do'.
		</text>
		<text> They would
emulate My behavior and certainly perish due to inaction.
		</text>
		<text> In this way, by not
doing My duties, I would be responsible for the destruction of virtuous people.
		</text>
		<text>

In the same way, you too are the son of the
virtuous Pandu and the brother of Yudhishtira.
		</text>
		<text> If you give up your activities,
people with limited knowledge who follow you would disregard their rights and
give up their actions.
		</text>
		<text> They will be destroyed.

be a champion must always stay in action.

[bhArata] Arjuna, [yathA]

without complete knowledge of the Self [kurvanti] do their work [karmaNi saktA:] while being attached to their actions, [tathA] in the same way, [vidvAn] the person who has realized the Self [kuryAt] must work [asakta:]

[vidvAn] A person with

		<text> [jOShayEt] In this

People without complete knowledge of the

		<text> They have a relationship with their actions
and it cannot be broken.

A person who has realized the Self would be

We realize our Self by
being active while acknowledging that we don't make things happen.

People who haven't realized the Self are unable

		<text> Due to the influence of past deeds, they are
bound to activity.
		</text>
		<text> Those who desire moksha are qualified
to work without
attachment to outcomes.
		</text>
		<text> A person who knows the Self must not cause
confusion by preaching a way to achieve moksha without the need for activity.
		</text>
		<text> 

What must he do then? As said previously,
such a person must work without attachment to outcomes as well.
		</text>
		<text> He is aware
that such activity leads to the realization of the Self - without the need to
contemplate.
		</text>
		<text> He must instill delight in all activity.
		</text>
		<text> 

Delight in your
activity.
		</text>
		<text> It is part of the Lord's play.
		</text>
		<text>

People who have realized the Self and those
who haven't - when both of them work without attachment to outcomes, then
what's the difference between them? In the next Shloka, the Lord explains the
difference.
		</text>
		<text> He also shows a way to realize that the Self is not the doer over
here.
		</text>
		<text> This will help in the practice of working
without attachments.

[ahankAra vimUDhAtmA] A person who, due to ignorance, thinks of his body as himself, [iti manyatE] keeps telling himself - [kartA aham] I am the doer [karmANi sarvasha:] of all actions - [prakr`tE: guNai: kriyamANAni] while these
actions are actually an effect of the qualities of nature.
		</text>
		<text>

[hE mahAbAho] Arjuna, [tattva vittu] the person who knows the factual [guNakarma
vibhAgayO:] distinctions among qualities and actions [na sajjatE] is not attached to them, [iti matvA] since he believes that [guNA guNEShu vartantE] the qualities of nature will anyway make the corresponding actions happen.
		</text>
		<text>



Without knowing the
Self, we believe that we are our body.
		</text>
		<text>

A person who is confused about the Self keeps
telling himself 'I do my actions', whenever the three qualities of nature make these actions happen.
		</text>
		<text> Such confusion comes to
a person when he thinks of himself as his body, instead of recognizing the Self
inside.
		</text>
		<text> Without knowing the Self, he believes that he's the one who makes things happen in the environment.
		</text>
		<text> 

Activity in the environment is an effect of
the three qualities of nature: sattva
(wisdom, virtue, truth), rajas (passion, emotion: cause of great
activity) and tamas (ignorance, darkness).
		</text>
		<text> When a person can distinguish
these three qualities and their effects, he realizes that those qualities
will make their effects happen anyway.
		</text>
		<text> When he recognizes that he's not the one
who makes things happen, he doesn't get
attached to them.

]

[akr`tsnavidO mandAn] People without complete knowledge of the Self [guNasammUDhA:] are deluded under the
influence of the three
qualities.
		</text>
		<text> [guNakarmasu
sajjantE] They are attached to actions, which are an
effect of the association with those qualities.
		</text>
		<text> [kr`tsnavit] A person who knows [tAn na vichAlayEt] must not mislead them.
		</text>
		<text>



Without complete knowledge, those who set
out to realize the Self are still mixed up with the environment.
		</text>
		<text> Being confused
by the qualities of the environment, they are
attached to activities linked to these qualities.
		</text>
		<text> They don't know the true form
of the Self, as something that's distinct from the environment.
		</text>
		<text> Hence, they are
unable to pursue knowledge directly.
		</text>
		<text> They are qualified only to work without
attachments.
		</text>
		<text>

If we know that the
environment makes things happen, why should we involve in activity at all?

Those without complete knowledge are
vulnerable.
		</text>
		<text> A person who is whole and complete must not mislead them.
		</text>
		<text> Being
vulnerable, they follow someone superior.
		</text>
		<text> That person would have risen by working without
attachment and would be beyond desires.
		</text>
		<text> Upon seeing his superiority, they may
move on and deviate from their activity.
		</text>
		<text> 

That's why a person who realizes the nature
of the Self, who is considered superior, must stay active - while practicing
the fact that the Self doesn't make things happen.
		</text>
		<text> This way, he demonstrates
that the technique of working without
attachment is a path by itself to realize the Self.
		</text>
		<text> He inspires those
without complete knowledge to be active.
		</text>
		<text>

Even in the realization
that the Self doesn't make things happen, be active and inspire others.
		</text>
		<text>

It has been stated already (Chap.3#21) that
the path of activity is the way to go, even for person who is capable of
realizing the Self directly.
		</text>
		<text> Such a person must work without
attachment for the benefit of the world.
		</text>
		<text> 

The nature of the Self is different from
any of the things we experience around us.
		</text>
		<text> With the knowledge of the Self, we
realize that the three qualities make things happen.
		</text>
		<text> These happenings are not in the
nature of the Self.
		</text>
		<text> Due to association with the
three qualities, it has obtained a particular body that involves in making
things happen.
		</text>
		<text>

In the next Shloka, it is stated that you
must perform your activities while planting the responsibility of making things
happen in Lord Krishna.
		</text>
		<text> The Self is like His body, being fully under His
control.
		</text>
		<text> He is the true owner of the Self and everything else.

[yudhyasva]
Fight [vigata jvara:] without
grief, [saMnyasya] dedicating [sarvANi karmANi] all actions [mayi] in Me, [adhyAtma
chEtasA] being aware of your relationship with me, [nirAshI:] being uninterested in outcomes, [nirmama:] without feeling 'it is mine'.
		</text>
		<text>



Dedicate your activity
to the Lord.
		</text>
		<text>

In this Shloka, the Lord says - 'dedicate all
actions in Me'.
		</text>
		<text> The phrase 'in Me' refers to the Supreme Lord, who is present
in every being.
		</text>
		<text> 

Dedicate all actions to the Supreme Lord
while keeping Him in your mind.
		</text>
		<text> Have no attachment to outcomes and don't be
possessive.
		</text>
		<text> Do all activity without grief or any other kind of pain.
		</text>
		<text> When you
are aware of the true nature of the Supreme Lord and the Self, your mind is
focused in Him.
		</text>
		<text> The 'true nature' of the Lord and the Self is known from the
scriptures.
		</text>
		<text> The Lord is described as:

'The One who pervades all conscious beings
and rules over them; One who is in everybody; One who is the 'doer' of actions'
[yajurAraNyaka, 3-11-21-23]

'One who is inside the Self, who is
distinct from the Self, one whom the Self does not realize, one for whom
the Self is like a body, one who controls the Self, is also within you.
		</text>
		<text> He is
without death; He is the Self in your Self.
		</text>
		<text>' [br'hadArAnyaka, 3-7-23]

The above references show us that the Lord
is the trigger of all activity.
		</text>
		<text> That He pervades the Self; that He controls it;
that the Self is the Lord's body; that it is the Lord who stimulates the Self.
		</text>
		<text>

'I am at the heart of everything.
		</text>
		<text>
Knowledge, memory and the ability to reason come from Me.
		</text>
		<text>' (Chap.15#15)

'The Supreme Lord sits at the heart of
every being, spinning all beings, mounting them in the mechanism of the
environment' (Chap.18#61).
		</text>
		<text>

The Lord has said- Your Self belongs to Me,
as though it were My body.
		</text>
		<text> Hence, consider Me as the trigger of all activity.
		</text>
		<text> Offer
your activities completely to Me, the Supreme Lord.
		</text>
		<text> Do those activities as a
means to worship Me alone.
		</text>
		<text> Do not desire other outcomes.
		</text>
		<text> Do not have the
feeling that 'these actions are mine'.
		</text>
		<text> Fight without any ill-feelings.
		</text>
		<text>

Everything happens by the will of The Lord, for his
pleasure alone.
		</text>
		<text>

Think of it this way: The Supreme Lord, who
controls everything, is the owner of your Self.
		</text>
		<text> The Lord causes the performance
of His own work using the Self and his own instruments, only to please Himself.
		</text>
		<text>


With this thought in mind, don't have any
possessive feelings like 'these are my actions'.
		</text>
		<text> Be free from anxieties like 'How
can I be liberated, given that I am bound to infinite actions and sins
committed since beginning-less past?' The Lord Himself, being worshiped by your
activity, will free you.
		</text>
		<text> Hence, do your work cheerfully without worrying about any
personal benefits they seem to bring.
		</text>
		<text>

The following scriptures also state that
the Lord is the supreme controller and that everything exists for His use:

'He is the supreme Lord to all the Lords;
The Owner of owners' [shvEtAshvatara, 6-7]

'The Lord of the Universe' [nArAyaNIya, 11-3]

Next, the Lord confirms this as the essence
of all the Upanishads:

People who [nityam anutiShTanti] constantly practice [idam mE matam] this
principle of mine, [shraddhAvanta:] those who believe in it, [anasUyanta:] and those who do not find fault in this principle - [tE api] all of them [karmabhi: muchyantE] will be free from the
influence of their actions.
		</text>
		<text>



We are bound to our limitations due to
actions we've committed since eternity.
		</text>
		<text> 

Even if we don't live this
all the time, it is still sufficient to simply accept His existence.
		</text>
		<text>

There are people who master the scriptures
and recognize that My principle is their
essence.
		</text>
		<text> They practice My principle diligently and will be free of all this bondage.
		</text>
		<text>
Others who believe in this principle but
don't practice it will be free as well.
		</text>
		<text> Yet others who do not resent and find
fault in this principle will also be free.
		</text>
		<text>

The phrase 'all of them' in this Shloka
signifies that they are all different types of people - those who practice,
those who simply believe and those who don't resent.
		</text>
		<text> All of them will lose
their misfortune and will end up practicing this
principle soon.
		</text>
		<text> They all attain moksha.
		</text>

In the next Shloka, The Lord explains the
flaw in those who resent The Lord's principle,
do not believe in it and those who have no intention of following it.

		</text>
		<text> [achEthsa:] They are
lackluster characters, [naShTAn] who are eventually wasted away.

On the other hand, there are people who do
not believe that everyone's Self is subordinate to Me; they don't believe that
their Self is like My body.
		</text>
		<text> There are those who do not believe that I am the
basis for their existence and deny that I am the ultimate cause of everything.
		</text>
		<text> People
who do not live in this context, who do not believe in it and resent this
principle - know them to be ignorant of all knowledge.
		</text>
		<text> They are wasted.
		</text>
		<text> Intelligence

		<text> Devoid of this,
they are lackluster beings.
		</text>
		<text>

When you deny that The
Lord is the basis of your existence, you live a myth.
		</text>
		<text>

For those of us who are bound to this
world, the feeling of 'I am the doer' comes due to the predominance of the three qualities.
		</text>
		<text> Consider everything that happens to be at the disposition
of The Lord and work without
attachment to outcomes.
		</text>
		<text> This is easy and everyone is entitled to it.
		</text>
		<text> 

Actions done in this way are free of fault
and do not bind us.
		</text>
		<text> They have the true knowledge of the Self embedded in them.
		</text>
		<text> These
actions don't need the support of any other technique.
		</text>
		<text> This technique is
recommended even to those who are capable of meditating on the Self.
		</text>
		<text> Other
techniques will anyway require activity, since we are endowed with a body.
		</text>
		<text> Pure
meditation that doesn't involve any activity is not possible.
		</text>
		<text>

It was already stated that people who are
famous must specially follow the technique of working
without attachment.
		</text>
		<text> Next, in the remainder of this chapter, The Lord says
that it isn't possible to gain the knowledge of the Self in any other way.

		<text> Any
technique that avoids activity is ridden with flaws.

Consider a person who knows the scriptures,
which describe the Self in a particular way, stating that you must always
restrain yourself and focus on the Self.
		</text>
		<text> Such a person is also drawn by the
influence of actions committed in the past.
		</text>
		<text> 

That's because all beings that are attached
to inanimate matter are drawn by the influence of the
three qualities.
		</text>
		<text> These qualities are the result of deeds committed since
eternity.
		</text>
		<text> Under such an influence, what can restraint do? Just knowing about 'restraint'
as prescribed in the scriptures doesn't help by itself.

		<text>

Next, it is explained how a person falls
under the influence of the three qualities and
gets trapped.

[rAga dvEShau]
Attachment and hatred [vyavasthitau] are an inseparable part of [indriyasya] the sense organs, [indriyasyArthE] when they are among sensory stimuli, like sights and sounds.
		</text>
		<text> [tayO: vasham na AgachChEt] Do not come
under their control, [tau hi]
since they [asya paripAthinau] are
the downfall of a person.
		</text>
		<text>



Sound, touch and other stimuli bring
awareness by activating the senses.
		</text>
		<text> Organs of activity give us the experience
of doing- for example, the organs of speech give us the experience of speaking.
		</text>
		<text>
The craving to experience them is desire, which is inevitable.
		</text>
		<text> This 'craving'
is a result of the influence of our deeds committed since ancient times.
		</text>
		<text> 

When the desired experience is blocked, it
inevitably results in ill-feelings like hatred.
		</text>
		<text> Desire and hatred together
bring us under their control.
		</text>
		<text> They use us to achieve their effects, even if we
have embarked on the journey to realize the Self, even if we have restrained our
sense organs.
		</text>
		<text> Once under their control, we divert from the path of realizing
the Self and will be destroyed.
		</text>
		<text> 

Even when you believe
in the Lord, desire and hatred are inevitable.
		</text>
		<text> Beware of them.
		</text>
		<text>

Once you have started on the path to realize
your Self, do not get destroyed by desire and hatred.
		</text>
		<text> So, beware of desire and
hatred- enemies that are very difficult to conquer; they can derail your
practice.

Working without attachment is your natural

That's because such actions are free from fault.

On the other hand, the process of realizing
the Self by meditation is a struggle for someone who is in this environment.

it may seem glorious, it has a high chance of divergence.

While working without attachments, if a
person passes away before realizing the Self in his current life, this practice
continues unperturbed in his next life.

For a person who is in touch with this

A person who has embarked on the journey to
realize the Self is still in contact with the material world.
		</text>
		<text> This world is
pervaded by the three qualities and is subject
to creation and destruction.
		</text>
		<text> The quality of rajas
triggers desire.
		</text>
		<text> This makes a person yearn for experiences that stimulate his sense
organs.
		</text>
		<text> This quality is accumulated due to activity committed over beginning-less time.
		</text>
		<text> 

It is an insatiable enemy, which pulls a
person towards the experiences of the material world.
		</text>
		<text> This desire turns into
anger when the desired experience is blocked.
		</text>
		<text> Anger is directed towards people
who are perceived to block the experience.
		</text>
		<text> This will compel a person to act
against other people.
		</text>
		<text> 

Recognize desire as the
cause of regret and guilt.
		</text>
		<text> It blocks your destiny.
		</text>
		<text> Look beyond desire.

Desire, which arises from the quality of
passion, is quite common; it is the one that blocks the realization of the
Self.

		<text> The knowledge of the Self is hidden by a constant enemy called
desire, which gets us entangled in worldly pleasures.
		</text>
		<text> This desire clings to us
due to two factors: Desire for things that we aren't supposed to own and never
being satisfied with what we have, never saying 'enough'.
		</text>
		<text>

What does this 'desire' use, to stay
attached to a conscious being and overpower the independence of the Self? The
next Shloka explains.

		<text> The body, mind and
intellect are said to be the abode of desire.

		<text> They tend to get attached to the

In this way, desire hides the Self,
conceals its knowledge and confuses a person.

from realizing the Self and turns him towards the sensual world.

[bharatarShabha] Arjuna, [tasmAt]
thus, [Adau] at the beginning
of your enterprise, [tvam indriyANi niyamya] establish control over your organs.
		</text>
		<text> [prajahi] Get rid of [Enam]
this source of wrong-doing, [jnAnavijnAna nashanam] which is responsible for hiding the knowledge of the Self and the
realization of its true nature.
		</text>
		<text>



For a person who intends to realize the
Self by meditation, this enemy called desire makes him turn towards worldly
attractions.
		</text>
		<text> It makes him turn away from the Self.
		</text>
		<text> Due to the nature of your
association with this world, you are still inclined towards the activities of your
sense organs.
		</text>
		<text> Hence, bind your organs to work without desire for outcomes -
right at the beginning of your quest to realize the Self and attain moksha.
		</text>
		<text>

Abandon desire in this way.
		</text>
		<text> Otherwise it
will destroy knowledge, wisdom and the realization of the true nature of the
Self.
		</text>

In the next Shloka, the Lord explains the
main obstacles to realize the Self.

[indriyANi] The
organs of the body [Ahu:] are
said to be [parANi] powerful
obstacles in the quest for the Self.
		</text>
		<text> [indriyEbhya:

		</text>
		<text> [manasastu parA] A more powerful obstacle
than the mind [buddhi:] is the

		</text>
		<text> [ya:] Who is [buddhE:

mentioned before.
		</text>
		<text>



It is said that our external organs are
prominent obstacles to realizing the Self.
		</text>
		<text> Indeed, when your sense organs
indulge themselves in the stimuli of this world, knowledge of the Self cannot
grow.
		</text>
		<text> 

The mind is even more powerful than these
organs.
		</text>
		<text> Even when you restrain your external organs, if your mind is
preoccupied with worldly objects, knowledge of the Self remains hidden.
		</text>
		<text> 

Even when the mind is restrained from all
such preoccupations, if the intellect decides against it, there is no way you
can realize the Self.
		</text>
		<text>

Even when the intellect is in the right
direction, 'desire', which is born out of the quality of rajas, will bring the organs and the mind under
its control.
		</text>
		<text> It will force them to indulge in worldly things.
		</text>
		<text> 

Thus, it will stop the person from
realizing the Self.
		</text>
		<text> In this way, desire is a more powerful obstacle than the
intellect.

		<text>Chapter
4

As long as a person is associated with the
material world, it isn't possible to stay away from activity - even though he
may seek liberation.
		</text>
		<text> This was explained by the Lord in
the third chapter.
		</text>
		<text> Hence a person needs to be active without being driven by
outcomes.
		</text>
		<text> The path of activity is recommended even for a person who is able to
focus on the Self.
		</text>
		<text> In particular, a person who is recognized as superior has
special responsibility to stay active in this way.
		</text>
		<text>

In the fourth chapter, the Lord starts by
saying that He imparted this knowledge to the initial beings of this world -
right at the beginning - to uplift everyone.
		</text>
		<text> Reinforcing the need to be active,
the Lord demonstrates that such activity has knowledge embedded in it.
		</text>
		<text> He
describes the characteristics of such activity and its variety.
		</text>
		<text> He goes on to
say that the main point of activity is knowledge.
		</text>
		<text> Along the way, he describes
the true nature of His birth.

[shrI bhagavAn uvAcha] Lord Krishna said [aham] I [prOktavAn]
preached [imam avyayam] this
eternal [yOgam] method [vivasvatE] to the brilliant one, the Sun.
		</text>
		<text> [vivasvAn] The Sun, as the originator of the
human race, [prAha] conveyed
this [manavE] to Manu.
		</text>
		<text> [manu:] Manu [abravIt] conveyed it to [ikShvAkavE] Ikshvaku.
		</text>
		<text>

[parantapa] Arjuna, [Evam] in
this way, [rAjarShaya:] kings who were also
sages [vidu:] knew this, [paramparA prAptam] having obtained the knowledge from previous generations.
		</text>
		<text> [mahatA kAlEna] Over a long period of time, [sa: yOga:] this method [naShTa:] was lost [iha] in this world.
		</text>
		<text>

[sa: Eva] The very same [purAtana:] ancient [yOga:]
method [mayA prOkta:] has been told
by me [tE] to you [iti] since [mE
bhakta:] you are my devotee [sakhA
cha] and my friend.
		</text>
		<text> [Etat hi] This is indeed [rahasyam] hidden knowledge [uttamam] of excellent nature.
		</text>
		<text>



The Lord says- 'I've
been teaching this method for millions of years'

The Lord says- In the previous chapter, I
described the
method of working without attachment.
		</text>
		<text> I didn't describe it merely to have
you make war.
		</text>
		<text> 

Right at the
beginning of the current manvantara (a period spanning 4,320,000 human years),
I preached this method to Vivasvan.
		</text>
		<text> I did that for the benefit of the world- To
enable people to achieve moksha, the ultimate goal.
		</text>
		<text>

Vivasvan conveyed this to Manu.
		</text>
		<text> Manu, in
turn, conveyed it to Ikshvaku.
		</text>
		<text> In this way, it was passed on from generation to
generation.
		</text>
		<text> It was known by kings
who were sages.
		</text>
		<text>

Though the method has remained unchanged
since ancient times, knowledge of this method was lost due to the weakness of
its listeners.
		</text>
		<text> I have taught you this very method in detail.
		</text>
		<text> I taught this due
to your friendship, due to your devotion and due to the fact that you
surrendered and approached me.
		</text>
		<text>

It's not possible for anyone other than Me
to know this method and speak about it, since it is knowledge of the highest
order.
		</text>
		<text> It is hidden in the Upanishads.
		</text>
		<text>

Continuing this conversation, Arjuna now
asks to know the real nature of the Lord's incarnation in its true form.

[arjuna uvAcha]
Arjuna said- [bhavatO janma]
Your birth [avaram] is recent.
		</text>
		<text> [vivasvata: janma] The birth of Vivasvan [param] was long ago.
		</text>
		<text> [katham vijAnIyAm] How can I understand [Etat] the fact, [tvam
Adau prOktavAn iti] that You are the person who said
this at the beginning?



Does the Lord
take birth?

Arjuna asks- Going by the passage of time,
Your birth is recent, in the same period as the rest of us.
		</text>
		<text> The birth of
Vivasvan happened a long time ago- 28 sets of four-yugas ago, as calculated by
the records.
		</text>
		<text> 

Yuga is a period of
time.
		</text>
		<text> There are four yugas: [kr`ta] or [satya]
with 1,728,000 years, [trEta] with 1,296,000 years, [dvApara] with 864,000 years and [kali] with 432,000 years.
		</text>
		<text>

A kalpa
is 14 sets of 71 yuga-cycles, or 4.3 billion years.
		</text>
		<text>

The statement that you were indeed the
person who spoke at the beginning of this period sounds impossible.
		</text>
		<text> How can I grasp
this fact in its real sense?

Of course, it can be explained that the
Lord spoke to Vivasvan in some other birth.
		</text>
		<text> Great people can remember their
deeds from a previous birth.
		</text>
		<text> So, there is no impossibility or contradiction
over here.
		</text>
		<text> Moreover, while conversing, it's not that Arjuna was unaware of
Krishna being the Lord of the universe.
		</text>
		<text> In fact, Arjuna himself says 'You are
the ultimate creator, the ultimate refuge and the ultimate in purity.
		</text>
		<text> You are a
person who is eternal, divine, the ultimate master- this has been told by all
the sages including Narada, Asita, Devala and Vyasa.
		</text>
		<text> You have told me the same.
		</text>
		<text>'
(See Chap.10#4
to Chap.10#13).
		</text>
		<text>

In Yudhishthira's Rajasuya, Bhishma and
others proclaimed again and again: 'Krishna himself is the ultimate cause for
the creation and destruction of the universe.
		</text>
		<text> All the conscious and unconscious
beings exist for Krishna's purpose only ([bhArata.
		</text>
		<text> sabhA]. 38-26)

This means the whole world is under
Krishna's control.
		</text>
		<text>

Arjuna's question can be detailed this way-
Arjuna knows that the son of Vasudeva is indeed the Lord.
		</text>
		<text> Yet, he asks as
though he doesn't know.
		</text>
		<text> 

This is the clarification he seeks: Is the
birth of the Lord in human form an illusion? 

The Lord is supreme and
there's nothing He needs.
		</text>
		<text> Why does he need to take birth in this world?

Consider this: The Lord destroys all
troubles and is the abode of all auspicious qualities.
		</text>
		<text> He is the controller of
everything and He knows everything.
		</text>
		<text> His purpose is always fulfilled and He has everything
He desires.
		</text>
		<text> He has now been born among mortals, who are bound to their actions.
		</text>
		<text>
Is this birth real? If so, what is the nature of this birth? What constitutes
the body that is born? What's the cause of this birth? When is this birth going
to happen? What's the goal of such a birth?

Arjuna sought clarifications to all these doubts
with his question.

The Lord says 'Many of my births have gone

similarity 'so have yours', the Lord invites us to a deeper understanding.

The Lord says- I take
birth by My own will, retaining all of my characteristics

I come into being in various incarnations
by My own will, while retaining My own qualities- I do not lose My quality of
being free from birth; I don't lose my nature of never wearing-out; I retain my
characteristic of being the Lord of all beings.
		</text>
		<text> I reside in My nature of being
the ultimate Lord.
		</text>
		<text> 

The phrase 'My nature' has been used to
mean 'The Lord's own qualities'.
		</text>
		<text> He says 'I come into being over here by My own
will, in My own form, retaining all the qualities of being the ultimate Lord'

The qualities of the Lord are described in
these scriptures:

He is the color of the Sun, beyond darkness
- [puruShasUkta]

He is unaffected by passions that wear out -
[sAma vEda]

The radiant person inside the Sun - [ChAndOgya]

The ever-lasting person who can be grasped
with a pure and clear mind [taittarIya]

All time periods originated from the one
whose form is electric [taittarIya]

Whose purpose is always fulfilled, who has
the universe within himself.
		</text>
		<text> He is all actions, all desires, all smells, all
tastes [ChAndOgya]

His form is like gold [br'hadArAnyaka]

In this Shloka, the word [mAya] means 'knowledge', the miracle of
awareness.
		</text>
		<text> It is said in [yaska nighantu dharmavarga 22]: 'He
knows the virtue and vice of all beings by His knowledge.
		</text>
		<text> His knowledge gives
rise to His 'will'- meaning, He consciously chooses a form as per His
intention.
		</text>
		<text>

He says 'I come into being in various
forms- both human and powerful forms- by My own will, retaining all My
auspicious qualities, being the destroyer of all misfortune, without giving up My
essential nature of being the Lord of all beings'

It is said in the [purushasUkta]:
'Though He is without birth, He is born in many forms'.
		</text>
		<text> This means He is not
born like other mortals.
		</text>
		<text> He is born of His own will in a form that He chooses.
		</text>
		<text>
Other parts of this chapter explain it as well: 'Many of My births have gone
by, so have yours, Arjuna.
		</text>
		<text> I know about all of them' (Chap.4#5); 'That's the
time when I make Myself come into being' (Chap.4#7); 'My birth and actions are
divine.

I form Myself, so that
My followers can grasp and worship Me.

My name, actions and form cannot be
expressed by speech or thought.
		</text>
		<text> Without seeing Me, My followers would neither
carry their body nor nourish it.
		</text>
		<text> They feel that passing a moment without seeing
Me is like the passing a thousand cycles of creation.
		</text>
		<text> They would lose strength
in their limbs if they don't see Me.
		</text>
		<text> I take birth to protect them, by showing Myself
and by interacting with them.
		</text>
		<text> My birth is also to destroy those who are opposed
to My followers.
		</text>
		<text>

To establish the principles laid down in
the Vedas, I enable people to worship Me by showing Myself in a form that can
be worshipped.

		<text> 

To accomplish these goals, I create Myself
over the ages in the form of a human, a power or even something else.

In this Shloka, the phrase 'various yugas'
conveys the meaning that the Lord has no preference for any particular yuga, such as [kr`ta] or [trEta]

knowledge about the real nature of My birth, without getting distracted.
		</text>
		<text> They
have reaped the benefits described previously.
		</text>
		<text> This is what the scriptures say:
'Learned people know the nature of His birth' [puruShasUkta].

In summary, The best among the wise will
know the real nature of the Lord's birth, as told in this chapter (Shlokas 5 to

[yO] Whoever [mAm prapadyantE] surrenders and takes

		<text> [pArtha] Arjuna, [manuShyA:] people [anuvartantE] will follow [mama vartma] My path [sarvasha:]
in every way.
		</text>
		<text>



I am easily grasped in any
form you expect.
		</text>
		<text>

To protect those who want to take refuge in
Me, I take the form of a man, a power or something else.
		</text>
		<text> That's not the only
thing I do.
		</text>
		<text> I also adore those who want to surrender and take refuge in Me.
		</text>
		<text> I
show myself in a way that's according to their expectation, as they picture Me
in their mind.
		</text>
		<text>

There's no need to elaborate the ease with
which a person can experience Me.
		</text>
		<text> It's very simple- All people who intend to
follow Me will follow My path and experience Me.
		</text>
		<text> I am not expressible by speech
or thought, even to those who practice the rigor of following Me.
		</text>
		<text> Yet, they
will experience Me with sense organs such as their eyes- in all places and in
all ways that they expect.
		</text>
		<text> In this way, they will follow Me.
		</text>
		<text>

Now, having completed the description of
His incarnations, He explains that knowledge is embedded in all actions that
are done without attachments (i.
		</text>
		<text>e.
		</text>
		<text>, in Karmayoga).
		</text>
		<text> In
the next Shloka, He says that people who practice such actions are rare.

[iha] Here, [yajantE] people worship and adore [dEvatA:] various gods or other powers, [kAnkShanta:] desiring [karmaNAm siddhim] accomplishment in their
actions.
		</text>
		<text> [hi] That's because [mAnuShE lOkE] in this world of humans, [karmajA siddhi:] the accomplishment arising
out of actions [kShipram bhavati] happens very quickly.
		</text>
		<text>



The
phrases 'gods' and 'other powers' are used to refer to people or forces of
nature that seem to have the power to grant us what we desire.
		</text>
		<text> They could be
parents, teachers, natural phenomena, corporate structures or influential
people.
		</text>
		<text> Often, we try to please them to achieve what we want.
		</text>
		<text>

All people desire to achieve the outcome of
their actions.
		</text>
		<text> For this, they worship and adore gods and various powers.
		</text>
		<text> In
reality, I am the one who resides in all gods and all powers, the basis for
their existence.
		</text>
		<text> I am the one who ultimately enjoys all worship.
		</text>
		<text> Yet, nobody
comes to Me by instinct.
		</text>
		<text> Why is it so?

Though the Lord is so
easy to grasp, we remain focused on other short-term accomplishments.
		</text>
		<text>

That's because in this world of humans, the
accomplishment of action happens very quickly - accomplishments such as gaining
wealth, the birth of a child, or having food.
		</text>
		<text>

The phrase 'world of humans' indicates the
material world.
		</text>
		<text> People in the material world lack knowledge, since the influence
of their infinite deeds committed over infinite time has not worn out yet.
		</text>
		<text> This
lack of knowledge makes them go after results that can be obtained quickly -
results such as comfort, wealth, children and food.
		</text>
		<text> For these, they work to
please the various powers.
		</text>
		<text> They don't work as prescribed before - they
cannot stay without attachment to outcomes and cannot work to worship Me.
		</text>
		<text> They
cannot be indifferent to the material world and focused on achieving moksha.
		</text>
		<text>

Next, He describes the way in which the
obstacles to start working without
attachments can be removed.
		</text>
		<text>

Since the link between the Shlokas at
the beginning of this chapter is a bit difficult to follow, let's draw an
outline over here: In Shloka #4, Arjuna asks Krishna about the nature of his
incarnation.
		</text>
		<text> Then Krishna replies: 'I retain all My qualities in My
incarnations.
		</text>
		<text> My actions are unaffected by the material world.
		</text>
		<text> Those who know
Me in this way will attain My qualities.
		</text>
		<text> They will surrender to Me and
experience Me as per their expectations.
		</text>
		<text> On the other hand, people try to please
the various powers that they perceive, in order to get worldly outcomes.
		</text>
		<text> That's
because these outcomes satisfy their desires quickly.
		</text>
		<text> In reality, I am the
enjoyer of all worship.
		</text>
		<text> People who work without being driven by desire, purely
as worship towards Me are rare.
		</text>
		<text> 

What does it mean to perform such
actions? Take My work of creation, for instance-

[chAturvarNyam]
The four characteristics [mayA sr`ShTam] were created by Me, [vibhAgasha:] classifying [guna]
qualities [karma] and the
associated work.

		</text>
		<text>



The four characteristics- [brAhmaNa] spirituality, [kShatriya] administration, [vaishya] trade, [shUdra] service- are prominent in all beings, right from Lord Brahma down
to the lowest germ in this world.
		</text>
		<text> This whole world was created by Me, going by
the distribution of qualities (sattva, rajas
and tamas) and the division of work according to the qualities.
		</text>
		<text>

The verb 'create' is illustrative over
here.
		</text>
		<text> Lord Krishna is also the protector and destroyer of the universe.
		</text>
		<text> In this
Shloka, He said- 'Know that I caused all of this.
		</text>
		<text> Know also, that I am not the
doer.

How come? He answers this in the next Shloka:

[karmANi]
Actions [mAm na limpanti] do
not stick to Me.
		</text>
		<text> [na mE] I
don't have [spr`hA] attachment [karma phalE] towards the outcome of
actions.
		</text>
		<text> [iti mAm yO_bhijAnAti]
The person who knows Me in this way [sa: na badhyatE] will not be bound [karmabhi:] by actions.
		</text>
		<text>



Activities such as creation don't stick to
Me- They do not bind Me.
		</text>
		<text> They are not sponsored by Me either.
		</text>
		<text> The diversity of
creation, like the various gods and humans, happens due to the deeds committed
by the created beings - deeds that are virtuous or otherwise.
		</text>
		<text> Thus, I'm not the
one who made this variety of creation happen, with the disparity of wisdom
among its various beings.
		</text>
		<text>

Given that the Lord is
supreme, is He the One who traps us in short-term gratification?

Conscious beings and material objects are
part of the Lord's creation.
		</text>
		<text> Conscious beings experience matter using organs
and bodies created for that purpose.
		</text>
		<text> Their experience happens according to
their past deeds.
		</text>
		<text> Such deeds were driven by attachment towards experiences and
results.
		</text>
		<text> These conscious beings have attachment to various deeds, such as the
creation of something.
		</text>
		<text> I don't have this attachment.
		</text>
		<text> 

The Lord doesn't trap
us.
		</text>
		<text> We are trapped by our own expectations.
		</text>
		<text>

Sutrakara says it in this way: [vaiShamyanaighr`NyO na
sApEkShatvAt]: 'The Lord does not have any prejudice or
mercilessness.
		</text>
		<text> They arise out of expectations that we have from our actions.
		</text>
		<text>' [vEdAnta sUtra] 2-1-34

Bhagavan Parashara says: 'In the act of
creating the world and its variety of different conscious beings, the Lord is
only the cause.
		</text>
		<text> The influence of past deeds is the instrument behind this variety
and inequality.
		</text>
		<text> Other than the cause, the conscious being doesn't expect
anything else.
		</text>
		<text> The conscious being is driven by the strength of its own deeds,
committed in the material world since ancient times [vishNu purANa] 1-4-51,52.
		</text>
		<text>

The essence of these references follows-

The Lord just initiates the creation of
this variety of conscious beings.
		</text>
		<text> The reason for differentiation among various
beings (like gods, humans, animals) is the influence of their past deeds.
		</text>
		<text>
Hence, other than the Lord as the ultimate cause of all creation, a conscious
being does not need anything external to obtain various forms.
		</text>
		<text> The influence of
its own past deeds is enough to make it assume various forms.
		</text>
		<text>

Whoever knows me in this manner is not
bound by his deeds.
		</text>
		<text> This person knows Me as the initiator of activities such as
creation.
		</text>
		<text> At the same time, he knows that I don't make the result of creation
happen, that I don't have attachment in their results.
		</text>
		<text> Such a person is freed
from all obstacles in the way of working without attachments- he will be free
from the influence of past deeds, which cause attachment towards the outcome of
activity.
		</text>
		<text>

In summary, the Lord is not merciless or
biased in the creation of varied conscious beings.
		</text>
		<text> The act of creation also
does not stick to him as something that He has done.
		</text>
		<text> Nothing here contradicts
the fact that He is the Lord of everything and controls everything.
		</text>
		<text> It's just
that He does not exercise his control indiscriminately.
		</text>
		<text> He permits things to
happen according to the influence of the past deeds of a conscious being.

People who sought moksha
knew me in this way during ancient times.

without attachments, in the manner described before.

In the same way, know My true form and abandon your faults too.

and Manu, practice the ancient technique of working without being driven by
desire- as I've already described previously.

difficult to know the true nature of activity, the elaboration of which follows
later.

What is activity? [kim akarma]
What's being free from activity? [atra] In this regard, [kavaya: api] even learned people [mOhitA:] are confused.

		<text> [tE pravakShyAmi] I will tell you [tat karma] that kind of activity, [yat jnAtvA] knowing which, [mOkShyasE] you will be freed from [ashubhAt] the unpleasant.

Given that we're
trapped by our experience, where does activity figure?

What's the nature of work done by a person
who wants to achieve moksha? What does it mean to be free
from activity?

Being free from activity is to know the
true nature of the Self.
		</text>
		<text> The Self initiates activity.
		</text>
		<text> Even the wise are
confused about the activities to pursue and the knowledge embedded in such
activity.
		</text>
		<text>

I will now tell you about these activities and
the knowledge embedded in them.
		</text>
		<text> By knowing them and practicing them, you will
be freed from the bonds of the world.
		</text>
		<text> This knowledge and practice will lead you
to work towards moksha.
		</text>
		<text> That itself is the ultimate
reward.
		</text>
		<text>

Be active without being
driven by desire.
		</text>
		<text> Be liberated from the burden of expectations.

Why is this so difficult to realize? He
explains this in the next Shloka.

[hi] Indeed, [karmaNa: api] the nature of activity [bOddhavyam] must be known.

		<text> [vikarmaNa:] The wide variety of activity [bOddhavyam] must be known [cha] too.

		</text>
		<text> [karmaNa: gati:] The consequences of actions
[gahanA] are extremely
difficult to understand.
		</text>
		<text>



Indeed, we must know the activities that lead
to moksha.
		</text>
		<text> We must know the variety of different actions too
- actions that we do daily, actions that are prescribed to us, actions that
arise out of desire and actions that gather worldly items to satisfy these
desires.
		</text>
		<text> We must know about being free from activity, which is the same as realizing
the true nature of the Self.
		</text>
		<text>

It's difficult to discern the course of
activities done to achieve moksha.
		</text>
		<text>

Variety in activity is perceived due to
their different outcomes - prescribed, routine, desire-driven and accumulation.
		</text>
		<text>
Look beyond this variety and aim at a single outcome called moksha.
		</text>
		<text>
All knowledge points to the same fact - it is the ultimate goal.
		</text>
		<text>

It is already stated in Chap2#41, that 'The
intellect, which perseveres to determine the nature of the Self is singular'.
		</text>
		<text>
It's not elaborated further over here.

free from activity and about being active.

When we know the true
nature of the Self, we realize that it isn't bound by activity.
		</text>
		<text> Things happen.
		</text>
		<text>

Awareness of the Self brings the 'freedom
from activity' mentioned here.
		</text>
		<text> This is distinct from merely doing our
activities.
		</text>
		<text> The Shloka says 'a person sees freedom from activity in action and
sees action in the freedom from activity'- What does this mean?

A person sees his own activities take the
form of awareness, when he works with the true nature of the Self.
		</text>
		<text> He also sees
this knowledge in the form of activity - since the knowledge of the Self is
embedded in action.
		</text>
		<text> He frames every work in the true nature of the Self, accomplishing
both the activity as well as the knowledge to be gained from it.
		</text>
		<text>

In this way, an intelligent person inquires
into the Self with his activities.
		</text>
		<text> He knows the entire essence of the
scriptures.
		</text>
		<text> He alone has realized everything specified in the scriptures.
		</text>
		<text> He
deserves moksha.
		</text>
		<text>

Activity is an inquiry
into the nature of the Self.

How do we realize the knowledge embedded in
our activity while experiencing this world? This is answered in the next
Shloka.

Here, 'a person' is someone who desires Moksha.

		<text> The phase 'every initiative' includes every
activity, whether it's routine, to gain material items or in pursuit of
interests.
		</text>
		<text> Every action is an initiative that is 'separate from desire', done
without attachment towards outcomes.
		</text>
		<text> Every action is also 'separate from
expectation'- meaning that such a person performs without equating himself with
the environment and its qualities, without
focusing on them.
		</text>
		<text> 

The Self is distinct from the environment.
		</text>
		<text>
Awareness of the Self will separate actions from expectations.
		</text>
		<text> Awareness of the
Self is like a fire.
		</text>
		<text> A wise person who works in this way is said to have
destroyed his past deeds in this fire.
		</text>
		<text> This awareness is contained within activities
that aren't driven by desires or expectations.

yajnAya Acharata: karma samagram
pravilIyatE || 23 ||
		</text>
		<text>

]

[jnAnAvasthita chEtasa:] Placing his consciousness in the knowledge of the Self, [yajnAya Acharata:] performing actions for
the sake of worship, [karmasamagram] all the past deeds [muktasya] of a person who is free from all possessions [pravilIyatE] will be destroyed without
exception.
		</text>
		<text>



By focusing his mind on the awareness of
the Self, he will lose attachment towards any other subject.
		</text>
		<text> He will be free
from all possessions.
		</text>
		<text> However, the past has a binding effect.
		</text>
		<text> By dedicating his
existence to worship the Lord with his activity, as
described before, he destroys the effects of his past deeds.
		</text>
		<text> None of his past
deeds are retained.
		</text>
		<text>

Such activity is associated with a focus on
knowing the real nature of the Self, which is detached from the environment.
		</text>
		<text> In
this way, the knowledge embedded in activity was explained.
		</text>
		<text> Next, this
knowledge is described by stating that all activities and their accessories are
associated with an aim to reach the Supreme Lord.

[brahmArpaNam]
With the implement of contribution, which is the work of the Lord, [brahma havi:] the offering, which is the
work of the Lord, [brahmaNA hutam] is offered by a person, who is the work of the Lord, [brahmAgnau] in the fire, which is the work
of the Lord.
		</text>
		<text> [brahmaiva tEna gantavyam] The Lord is certainly reached by [brahma
karma samAdhinA] a person who firmly believes that every
activity has the Lord embedded in it.
		</text>
		<text>



All activities burn
something provided by the Lord, for the purpose of the Lord.
		</text>
		<text> This is worship.
		</text>
		<text>

The firm belief that all actions have the
Lord as their basis, that all actions are pervaded by the Lord is explained
here.
		</text>
		<text>

Every time we work, we intend to make a
contribution to others or to ourselves.
		</text>
		<text> For the explanation here, consider our activity
to be analogous to making a contribution or offering to the fire.
		</text>
		<text>

While making an offering during worship,
the contribution is being offered to the Lord.
		</text>
		<text> The ladle that is used to make
the offering is the implement which helps us in our work.
		</text>
		<text> By virtue of being a
work of the Lord, it is the same as the Lord.
		</text>
		<text> The ladle used in contributing
the offering to the Lord is itself pervaded by the Lord.
		</text>
		<text>

In this way, the contribution, the tool
used in the work, the fire into which the contribution is made and the doer
himself - all these are pervaded by the Lord.
		</text>
		<text> In this way, all actions have the
Lord embedded in them.
		</text>
		<text>

The person who firmly believes that all
actions are pervaded by the Lord will certainly reach the Lord.
		</text>
		<text> He will gain
the knowledge of the Self with the Lord embedded in it - The Self that's pervaded
by the Lord.
		</text>
		<text>

In summary, a person who desires moksha works with the firm belief that every activity is pervaded
by the Lord.
		</text>
		<text> With this belief, his activity leads him to realize the true
nature of the Self.
		</text>
		<text> This will lead the person to know the Self without needing
an exclusive
pursuit of knowledge.
		</text>
		<text>

In this way, after teaching the knowledge
that's embedded in activity, The Lord goes ahead to describe the different methods
of working without being driven by outcomes.
		</text>
		<text>



The translation here has made a few
interpretations.
		</text>
		<text> [brahmakArya] in the commentary has been translated to 'work of the Lord', which
could either mean 'The Lord is the cause of it', or it could mean 'being
performed for the Lord'.
		</text>
		<text> Though they mean two different things, both are
valid meanings.
		</text>
		<text> Also, phrases like [tat brahma] - 'it is the Lord' - have been translated to 'it is the same as the
Lord'.
		</text>
		<text> While reading this, equate it to 'being pervaded by the Lord'.
		</text>
		<text> Of
course, the whole universe is pervaded by the Lord.
		</text>
		<text> This firm belief while working
will lead us to realize the Self and reach the Lord.
		</text>
		<text>

How do I worship
with activity?

The Lord tells Arjuna: You are deluded
right now, thinking that your body is your Self and falling for the resultant
feeling of possessiveness.
		</text>
		<text> You will not get deluded after knowing the true
nature of the Self.
		</text>
		<text>

With this knowledge, you will see all
beings- including those we call as humans and gods- within your Self.
		</text>
		<text> That's
because all beings, when detached from the material environment, have a form
that consists of knowledge alone.
		</text>
		<text> That includes you.
		</text>
		<text> In this way, all beings
are equivalent.
		</text>
		<text> The nature of the Self is always the same when it is freed from
the limitations of associating with the environment.
		</text>
		<text> This fact is stated again in
(Chap.5#19): 'Freed from all these limitations, the Self is equivalent in
nature to the Lord.
		</text>
		<text> Hence, they are situated within the Lord'.
		</text>
		<text>

In this way, you will see all beings in Me
without any exception.
		</text>
		<text> Due to the fact that the Self in each being is
equivalent in nature to the Lord, it is totally flawless, as said in
(Chap14#2): 'Having gained this knowledge, they achieve My characteristics'.
		</text>
		<text>

It is also stated in [muMDaka upanishad 3-1-3]: 'Having gained this knowledge, a person will give up his good and
bad deeds, become flawless and achieve the ultimate equality'.
		</text>
		<text> In this way, the
various scriptures illustrate that the Self, when freed from everything that
has a name, attains a form that's equivalent to the Lord.

When freed from the material environment,
the Self in every being is alike and equivalent in nature to the Lord.

A person who doesn't have this knowledge or

The fourth chapter described activities
that aren't driven by attachment.
		</text>
		<text> Such activities stand out by the knowledge
embedded in them.
		</text>
		<text> It was said (Chap.4#33) that these activities are pervaded by
knowledge.
		</text>
		<text> Before that, in the third chapter (see Chap.3#8), it was said that
activity is the way to go- even for those who are capable of exclusive contemplation.
		</text>
		<text>
Realization through activity is preferred to contemplation.
		</text>
		<text> This is due to the
purity and knowledge contained in such activity.
		</text>
		<text> Moreover, these activities don't
require any other prerequisites or accessories.
		</text>
		<text>

This chapter explains that working without
attachment is a quicker technique to realize the true nature of the Self,
in comparison to exclusive contemplation.
		</text>
		<text> It also gives the method to
internalize and apply the concept of 'I am not the doer'- a concept that's embedded
in such work.

Arjuna says: [kr`ShNa] O Krishna, [shamsasi] You recommend [karmaNAm saMnyAsam] giving up actions.
		</text>
		<text> [puna:] You also [yOgam cha] recommend determined and skillful action, without being driven by
attachments.
		</text>
		<text> [EtayO:] Among
these two paths, [yat shrEya:]
which one is preferred? [tat mE brUhi sunishchitam] Tell that to me clearly.
		</text>

Arjuna said to Krishna: You recommend
giving up the activities of our organs and focusing on knowledge (Chap.2#55).
		</text>
		<text>
Then, you recommend activities that are free of attachments.
		</text>
		<text>

Isn't it easier to
realize the Self by contemplation, instead of doing all kinds of activities?

To elaborate: In the second chapter, it was
said that the starting point for a person who wishes to achieve moksha is to work without being driven by desire.
		</text>
		<text> By working
in this manner, we get rid of our faults, after which we are able to contemplate
our Self.
		</text>
		<text> Then, in the third and fourth chapters, it is said that activity is preferred
even for a person who is able to contemplate exclusively.
		</text>
		<text> Further, You said
that activity
without attachments - purely done as worship to the Lord - in itself is the
way to realize the Self, without having to contemplate exclusively.
		</text>
		<text> In this
way, You advocated such activity.
		</text>
		<text>

Tell me which one of these is preferred: Contemplating
the Self while giving up activity? Or working without being driven by
attachments? Which is the easier and quicker way to realize the Self?

		<text> [tayOstu] Among them, [karmayOga:] work that's not driven by desire [vishiShyatE] stands out [karma saMnyAsAt] in preference to giving up work itself.

The Lord said - Liberation is achieved by either
technique - by contemplating without any activity, or by activity that's not driven
by attachments.

		<text> The latter is available even for a person who is able to contemplate
exclusively.

[mahAbAhO] Arjuna,
[ya:] The person who [na kAnkShati] is not addicted to desires [na dvEShTi] and is not carried away by
hatred - [sa:] he [nirdvandva:] has overcome dualities.
		</text>
		<text> [nityasaMnyAsI jnEya:] it is to be known,

		</text>
		<text> [sa: hi] He alone [sukham pramuchyatE] is easily freed [bandhAt] from the limitations of this world.
		</text>
		<text>



Working without being
driven is the quickest way to look beyond desires

The person who practices the technique of working
without attachment is satisfied with the experience of the Self.
		</text>
		<text> This
experience is embedded in the technique.
		</text>
		<text> He does not yearn for anything else.
		</text>
		<text>
In the same way, he does not hate anything either.
		</text>
		<text> In this way, he tolerates
all dualities (such as hot and cold, joy and sorrow).
		</text>
		<text> He is the one who has
given up all worldly things - he alone is known to pursue the knowledge of the
Self.
		</text>
		<text> That is equivalent to contemplation.
		</text>
		<text>
He alone will be freed from worldly limitations with ease - due to his
diligence in working without being driven by attachments.
		</text>
		<text>

In the next Shloka, the Lord says that the
techniques of contemplation
and activity
are mutually independent.

		<text> [sarvabhUta Atma bhUtAtmA] He considers the Self that's present in all beings as being equal
to his own Self [na lipyatE]
and is not stuck to anything, [kurvannapi] even though he keeps doing his work.
		</text>
		<text>



A person who is dedicated to working
independent of desire isn't stuck to his deeds, even though he is involved in
doing them.
		</text>
		<text> What is the state of such a person? How come the deeds don't stick
to him? That is explained here.
		</text>
		<text> 

The Self in every
person is identical.
		</text>
		<text> It doesn't make anything happen.
		</text>
		<text>

Such a person works free from the influence
of desire.
		</text>
		<text> His activities are done purely as worship to the Lord, as described
in the scriptures.
		</text>
		<text> With that, his mind is purified - it is not under the
control of various desires.
		</text>
		<text> In this way, he gains control over himself.
		</text>
		<text> He has
conquered his mind easily, by keeping it engaged and focused on his own work.
		</text>
		<text> With
this, he easily keeps his organs under control.
		</text>
		<text> 

He dedicates himself to an inquiry into the
true nature of the Self, which is the author of actions.
		</text>
		<text> Due to this
dedication, he realizes that the Self within himself is of the same nature as
the 'Self' that's present in everyone.
		</text>
		<text> The non-uniform effects of nature result
in the variety of beings that we see.
		</text>
		<text> These cannot indicate that a different
form of the Self exists in everyone.
		</text>
		<text> When the Self is freed of the influence of
nature, it has identical form inside everybody.
		</text>
		<text> This is elaborated in one of
the next Shlokas (Chap.5#19).
		</text>
		<text> 

Being in this state, this person does not
get stuck with the idea that something that's not the Self, is actually the
Self.
		</text>
		<text> In this way he quickly realizes the Self.
		</text>
		<text> Thus, activity is easier and
faster than contemplation and is definitely preferred.

Now listen to what's needed to apply the
technique of working without being driven.

[tatvavit] A

[manyEta] and knows that [naiva kinchit karOmi] 'I do not do anything'

when his eyes are open [nimiShan api] and when they are shut.

In this way, a person who knows the Self
will consider that all organs of the body will be among the objects sensed and
perceived by them.
		</text>
		<text> This includes sensory organs such as the ears, organs of
action such as those associated with speech and organs involved in involuntary
activities.
		</text>
		<text> This person knows that 'I do not make anything happen'.
		</text>
		<text> 

The illusion that we
make things happen is a result of our past deeds.
		</text>
		<text>

The belief that 'I am the one who makes it
happen' arises out of the association with our organs and actions required to
sustain ourselves.
		</text>
		<text> This association is a result of our past deeds.
		</text>
		<text> It is not
our inherent nature.
		</text>
		<text> Our innate characteristic is that of pure knowledge and
knowledge alone.

Chap.5#8 - 'while seeing, hearing, touching'

The word 'Nature' refers to the environment

		<text> While doing his work in this way,
he will be bound by his actions always.
		</text>
		<text> He will always be attached to the
stimuli of this world.
		</text>
		<text>

In summary, it is said here that the
purpose of your activity is only to relieve the Self of its binding.
		</text>
		<text> Don't be
driven by expectations regarding the outcomes of your actions.
		</text>
		<text> Give up your
actions in nature, which has taken the form of your organs.

Next, The Lord talks about giving up
'doer-ship' in the environment itself, a part of which is your body.

		<text>

]





 [saMnyasya] Having given up [sarva karmANi] all actions [navadvArE pure] in the city with nine gates (the body) [manasA] using the mind, [dEhI] the Self, which is the owner of the body [vashI] will control his organs [sukham AstE] and stay content [naiva kurvan na kArayan] without committing any action directly or indirectly.
		</text>
		<text>



Actions&#8203; are 'committed' when we
work with the feeling of 'I am the doer', being driven by some desire.
		</text>
		<text> All that work is done by our body.
		</text>
		<text> This Shloka describes our
body as a city - it's a complex ecosystem with specialized parts, It has nine opening
'gates' - two eyes, two nostrils, two ears, one mouth and the two excretory
organs.
		</text>
		<text>

While working, the feeling that 'I am the
doer' is due to the relationship with our body.
		</text>
		<text> That is in turn due to the actions
of our Self, committed since ancient times.
		</text>
		<text>

When our mind is enlightened by this fact,
we know that attachments are not in our true nature.
		</text>
		<text> The Self leaves all
actions in the city with nine gates.
		</text>
		<text> With this, the Self stops struggling to
stay within the refuge of the body.
		</text>
		<text> Realizing that it owns the body out of circumstance
and not by nature, the Self remains content without committing the actions of
the body.
		</text>
		<text>

In the next Shloka, the Lord clearly
describes the state of being of the Self.

[prabhu:] The
Self [na sr`jati] does not
create [kartr`tvam] the
impression of making things happen, [lOkasya] an impression associated with this material world.
		</text>
		<text> [karmANi na] Neither does it create the

inseparably linked with these actions.

		<text> [svabhAvastu] The nature of this material world [pravartatE] prevails.
		</text>
		<text>



Happenings and
asymmetry belong in the environment.
		</text>
		<text>

By its very nature, the Self is free of the
influence of actions.
		</text>
		<text> It does not manufacture the impression of making things
happen, which is associated with this world of humans, gods, animals and inanimate things.
		</text>
		<text> Neither
does it make the actions of this world, nor the outcomes that are apparently
linked to the actions - both of which are not within its inherent nature.

who is it that creates them?

He says 'It naturally prevails': Here, the
word 'naturally' refers to the notions created by nature.
		</text>
		<text> Various actions
committed since ancient times have generated our association with our bodies
and the nature around us.
		</text>
		<text> This generates an opinion that our body itself is our
Self.
		</text>
		<text> Under the influence of this opinion, the impression that 'I make things

ajnAnEna
Avr`tam jnAnam tEna muhyanti jantava: || 15 ||

[vibhu:] The
omnipresent Self [nAdattE] does
not take up [kasyachit pApam]
anyone's sinful deeds.
		</text>
		<text> [na chaiva] Nor does it take up [sukr`tam] any virtuous deeds.
		</text>
		<text> [jnAnam] The inherent knowledge in the Self [Avr`tam] is concealed [ajnAnEna] by ignorance.
		</text>
		<text> [tEna] Due to this, [jantava:] the various beings [muhyanti] are misled into believing that the body is their Self.
		</text>
		<text>



It is stated here, that 'the Self does not
take over the sins and virtuous deeds of anyone'.
		</text>
		<text> To elaborate, it cannot
remove the sins of people whom we love, such as our children.
		</text>
		<text> Neither does it
take away the virtuous deeds of those we dislike.
		</text>
		<text> The word 'omnipresent' has
been used to describe the Self over here, meaning that the Self is not confined
to a certain space.
		</text>
		<text> Being confined in a body, or having various relationships
(either good or bad) is not a part of its natural state.
		</text>
		<text> All this is made up by
notions created out of past deeds.
		</text>
		<text> 

The Self is pure
knowledge, covered over by ignorance.
		</text>
		<text> This makes the variety of this world.
		</text>
		<text>

How did these notions, which drive against
the basic nature of the Self, come into being? The answer has been stated in
this Shloka: 'The inherent knowledge in the Self is concealed by ignorance'.
		</text>
		<text>
What this sentence says is: We're constrained to experience the results of our
actions, because the knowledge inherent within the Self is concealed by the
influence of our actions - which we have committed since ancient times.
		</text>
		<text> This
influence is unfavorable to the realization of the Self.
		</text>
		<text> In this way, the true
nature of the Self - a form that is pure and infinite knowledge, is concealed
by the influence of ancient actions committed by us.
		</text>
		<text>

Due to this influence, it gets associated
with a particular body at a given point in time, resulting in mistaken notions
about the Self.
		</text>
		<text> We derive perceptions, judgements and desires out of the
results of our actions, in line with these mistaken notions about ourselves.
		</text>
		<text>
Due to these notions, an impression of the Self arises, which is not at all our
inherent nature.
		</text>
		<text> From that, the deeds that we commit arise - these are driven
by our desires and they add on to the influence of our ancient actions.
		</text>
		<text>

Next, the Lord links up the statements in
Chap.4#36 ('You will cross over all the misery by the boat of knowledge
alone'), Chap.4#37 ('In the same way, the fire of knowledge will burn down all
your past actions'), Chap.4#38 ('There is nothing in this world, which is equal
to knowledge in its flawlessness') and praises the appropriateness of the message contained in them.

tEShAm

[jnAnam]
Knowledge [Adityavat prakAshayati] shines like the sun [tEShAm] in people [yEShAm]
whose [tat ajnAnam] ignorance [nAshitam] is destroyed [Atmana: jnAnEna] by the knowledge of the
Self.
		</text>
		<text> [tatparam] This knowledge
is their ultimate goal.
		</text>
		<text>



All beings who exist in this way are
plagued by ignorance and doubt, generated by actions committed since eternity.
		</text>
		<text> A
few of them get guidance about the nature of the Self, like it was described.
		</text>
		<text> By
knowing the Self in this way, they practice in abundance daily and gain comprehension.
		</text>
		<text>
With limitlessly pure knowledge, their ignorance and doubt are destroyed.
		</text>
		<text> The
supreme knowledge that's inherent in them isn't constrained anymore.
		</text>
		<text> It shines
by itself in its true form, like the brightness that's inherent in the sun.
		</text>
		<text>

The word 'their' reinforces the
multiplicity of Selves that have got rid of their ignorance.
		</text>
		<text> The description of
multiple Selves started in Chap.2#12: 'At any point in time, it has never been
that we did not exist'.
		</text>
		<text> It is clarified further over here.
		</text>
		<text> This multiplicity
couldn't have been a mistaken illusion.
		</text>
		<text> That's because in this Shloka, the word
'their' is about people who have lost their ignorance.
		</text>
		<text>

By saying 'their knowledge shines like the
sun', this Shloka makes a distinct relationship between the Self and its
knowledge.
		</text>
		<text> It illustrates that knowledge is associated with the Self its very
nature.
		</text>
		<text> It's an association between everything that has to be known and the knower.
		</text>
		<text>
Like the relationship between brilliance and the brilliant sun.
		</text>
		<text> 

In this way, worldly pursuit constrains our
knowledge.
		</text>
		<text> In the state of moksha, this knowledge is
unlimited and unconstrained.

The phrase 'here itself' means 'while being

		<text> 

While still being in the endeavor to
realize the Self and achieve Moksha, the material world is
conquered when the mind is situated in the equality of the Self in every being.
		</text>
		<text>
The phrase 'When devoid of faults' denotes a state of being in which we are
free from the limitations of this material world.
		</text>
		<text> 

In this state, the Self in each of us is whole
and complete - the Self, in its pure form, devoid of the association with the
material world, is equal to the Lord.
		</text>
		<text> 'Being situated in the equality of the
Self' is the same as being situated in the Lord.
		</text>
		<text> In this way, they conquer the
material world (in other words, they are no longer controlled by the
material world).

		<text>

In summary, people who strive to recognize
the equality of the Self in everyone are already liberated.

		<text> They know that the
Self in everyone has a form that's pure and infinite knowledge, 

The next Shloka describes the manner in
which a person who works without
attachment exists and matures the knowledge that manifests in the form of
equality.

[muni:] A
person having the intention to realize the Self, [mOkSha
parAyaNa:] who has moksha as his
only goal, [bAhyaN sparshAn]
keeps external stimuli [bahi: kr`tvA] outside [chakShu: chaiva] and the eyes focused [bhruvO: antarE] in-between the eye-brows.
		</text>
		<text> [samau kr`tvA] Balancing [prAna apAnau] the inhalation and exhalation [nAsAbhyanrara] that go through the nose, [yatEndriya manO
buddhi:] he takes charge of his organs, mind and his
intellect.
		</text>
		<text> [vigatIchChA bhaya krOdha:] He is beyond desire, fear and anger.
		</text>
		<text> [ya:] Such a person [sa: sadA mukta Eva] stays liberated from this material world.
		</text>
		<text>



'Keep external stimuli outside' is to
conquer all activities of the external organs, so they aren't dictated by
desire and anger anymore.
		</text>
		<text> A person whose organs, mind and intellect are
incapable of being out of the journey to realize the Self is freed from desire
and anger.
		</text>
		<text>

This person has the intention to realize
the Self and his only goal is to attain moksha.
		</text>
		<text> He is
already in the state of liberation.
		</text>
		<text> He sits erect in a position suitable for
concentrating on the Self, focusing the eyes between the eye-brows, where the
nose starts, balancing inhalation and exhalation.
		</text>
		<text> Even when he is in the
journey to reach the goal, he is already liberated - Similar to his state of
being when he actually achieves the goal of moksha.
		</text>
		<text>

In this technique of working
without being driven by desire, our routine and necessary activities
themselves can easily be employed to realize the Self.
		</text>
		<text> The Lord explains this
next.

also the friend and ally of everyone.

person who [karma karOti] does
the work&#8203; [kAryam] that's to

A person who isn't driven by outcomes does
his work as activity, even without the expectation that good deeds will do him
good in return.
		</text>
		<text> This person works with an attitude- 'I do this to worship the
Supreme Lord&#8203;, who is the Self within every Self and our friend forever'.
		</text>
		<text>
This person works with the activity itself as the goal, not anything else
that's achieved.

He has renounced all compulsions and is focused on
the knowledge of the Self.
		</text>
		<text> He is skillful in his
activity as well.
		</text>
		<text> He is a champion in his activity, doing it as a form of
contemplating the Self.

This Shloka says that such a person is not without

		<text> He is dedicated in his work and doesn't avoid it.

described above, his activity is His worship.

[pAndava] Arjuna,
[viddhi] know that [yam saMnyAsa iti prAhu:] what's called
renunciation [tam yOgam] is
activity that isn't driven by desire.
		</text>
		<text> [asaMnyasta
sankalpa: kashchana] Anyone who doesn't give up expectations
[yOgI na bhavati hi] cannot
practice such activity.
		</text>
		<text>



We get driven by
expectations when we think that we are our body.
		</text>
		<text>

When you work without being
driven, you contemplate the true nature of the Self.
		</text>
		<text> He completes the
picture by saying- Anyone who doesn't give up expectations cannot practice such
activity.
		</text>
		<text> 

A person gives up expectations when he contemplates
the Self in its true form, being free of the notion that he is the body.
		</text>
		<text> As
long as he considers himself to be something other than the Self, he mixes the
Self and the body, getting attached to expectations.
		</text>
		<text> Such a person will not
work without being driven by desire.
		</text>
		<text>

Chap.4#19 talks about such a person: 'A
person whose every initiative is separated from desire and expectation'.
		</text>
		<text>

The next Shloka says that only such activity achieves
realization without misleading us.

A person who wants to realize the Self and
be liberated needs to work without being
driven by desire.

		<text> Once this
very person has achieved proficiency in working this way, tranquility is said
to be his principle of existence.
		</text>
		<text> 

Tranquility of the Self
is gained by working without being driven

To summarize- till the goal of
Self-realization and moksha are achieved, you must work without being
driven by desire.
		</text>
		<text>

When is this proficiency achieved? In the practice
of working without
being driven, when do we say that we've 'arrived'?

[yadA hi] When [na anuShajjatE] a person is not attached to
[indriyArthEShu] sensual things,
[na karmasu] nor to the
activities associated with those stimuli, [tadA] then, [sarva sankalpa saMnyAsI] he is free from attachments towards desires.
		</text>
		<text> [yOgArUDha: tadOchyatE] He is said to be
firmly situated in the realization of the Self.
		</text>
		<text>



When a person works independent of desire,
he gives up attachment towards things that are unrelated to the experience of
the Self.
		</text>
		<text> These are things in the material world that stimulate sense organs -
taste, smell and so on.
		</text>
		<text> The natural inclination of this person is to realize
the Self alone.
		</text>
		<text> He gives up attachment to material stimuli and the activities
done to react on them.
		</text>
		<text> 

In this state, he is considered to be
situated firmly in the true nature of the Self, having freed himself of all
desires.
		</text>
		<text> 

However, a person who wants to ascend to
that state is still susceptible to the stimuli of the material world.
		</text>
		<text> Hence, he
needs to practice working
without being driven by desire, purely as worship to the Lord.
		</text>
		<text> In this way,
he practices the art of giving up attachment towards the material world and the
art of meditation to realize the Self.
		</text>
		<text> This technique of [karmayOga]
is the only way available to him and he needs to practice just that.

Driving or being driven
- it's your choice

A person can win his mind from the material
world using the native qualities of the Self.
		</text>
		<text> Then, his mind is his friend.
		</text>
		<text> 

On the other hand, a person who hasn't won
over his mind, who has not focused his mind on realizing the Self will have the
mind opposing him, like it was his enemy.
		</text>
		<text> Such a mind will work to counter the
achievement of knowledge and the ultimate bliss it brings.
		</text>
		<text>

This is told by Sri Parashara too, in [vishNu purAna], 6-7-28: 'The mind with its intentions is the cause for a person's bondage
and liberation.
		</text>
		<text> Intentions that are tied to the material world lead to bondage.
		</text>
		<text>
For liberation, our intentions must be detached from the
stimuli of the material world.

is suitable to start on the journey to realize the Self.

People who don't have a reason to wish us
good or bad are those who are disinterested.

[arjuna] Arjuna, [yOga: nAsti] the quest for the realization of the Self is not [atyashnatastu] for one who eats
excessively.
		</text>
		<text> [anashnata:] A
person who does not eat [na chaikAntyam] will not have a singularity of purpose either.
		</text>
		<text> [na] It is not [ati
svapna shIlasya cha] for a person who sleeps
excessively either.
		</text>
		<text> [jAgratO naiva cha] Neither is it for a person who is awake all the time.
		</text>
		<text>

[yOga:]
This quest [du:kha hA bhavati]
will be the destroyer of sorrow [yukta AhAra vihArasya] for one who eats and enjoys appropriately, [karmasu
yukta chEShTasya] and exerts himself appropriately in
his work.
		</text>
		<text> 



Eating too much, or not eating at all -
both of these are obstacles to realizing the Self.
		</text>
		<text> Getting diverted excessively
goes against realizing the Self.
		</text>
		<text> So does the avoidance of all leisure.
		</text>
		<text>
Similarly, sleeping too much, sleeping too less, exerting ourselves beyond
limit and avoiding exertion are obstacles to realizing the Self.
		</text>
		<text>

The realization of the Self happens to a person
who exercises control.
		</text>
		<text> This person is prudent in eating, leisure, exertion, in
sleep and in staying awake.
		</text>
		<text> Such a realization of the Self destroys all bondage
and limitation.

[yadA] When [chittam] a person's consciousness [avatiShThatE] stays [viniyatam] firm [Atmani
Eva] in the Self alone, [ni:spr`ha:] without attachments [sarva kAmEbhya:] towards any desires, [tadA] then [yukta: ityuchyatE] the person is said to be focused and deserves to realize the Self.
		</text>
		<text>



The consciousness is by nature looking for
benefits and outcomes.
		</text>
		<text> When it is stationed firmly in the Self, it is turned
towards the ultimate benefit (moksha) and thus
stays focused, unmoved.
		</text>
		<text> When this happens, the person stands free of attachment
towards all desires.
		</text>
		<text> 

He is said to have the focus and deserves
to realize the Self.

[Atmana:] The
Self [yOgina:] in a person who works purely
as worship to the Lord, [yatachittasya] who controls his consciousness, [yOgam
yunjata:] who is dedicated and focused in his quest to
realize the Self [sOpamA smr`tA] is considered similar to [dIpa:] a flame [yathA nEngatE] that stays without shaking [nivAtastha:] in a place without winds.
		</text>

A flame in a place devoid of wind does not waver.
		</text>
		<text>
It shines bright and steady.
		</text>
		<text> In the same way, the Self shines in a person who
practices works
without being driven, who is not interested in anything other than the Self
and the Lord, who is focused in his quest to realize the Self.
		</text>
		<text> 

A flame unaffected by the wind is analogous
to the Self that shines in the form of pure knowledge, unmoved by all other
interests and desires.

[yatra] The state of being, in which [niruddham
chittam] the consciousness, controlled and focused [yOga sEvayA] for the purpose of realizing
the Self and the Lord [uparamatE] experiences ultimate joy,

[yatra cha] in which [AtmAnam pashyan] the consciousness sees the Self [AtmanA] by using the mind [Atmani Eva tuShyati] and is content in the knowledge of the Self alone,

[yatra] in which [vEtti] it
knows [yattat sukham atyantikam] the unparalleled joy, which [buddhigrAhyam] can only be grasped by knowledge [atIndriyam], being beyond the reach of the senses [chaiva] and indeed, [ayam]
when it is [sthita:] situated
in that state, [na chalati] it
does not move [tatvata:] from
this ultimate reality.
		</text>
		<text>

[yam labdhvA cha] Further, having attained that state, [manyatE
na] it does not consider [aparam] other [lAbham]
benefits [adhikam tata:] to be
more valuable.
		</text>
		<text> 

[yasmin sthitE] While being in this state [na vichAlyatE] it does not get toppled [guruNA_pi] even by huge [du:khEna] difficulties and sorrows.
		</text>
		<text>

[vidyAt] Know that [tam du:khasamyOga viyOgam] this state of being, which detaches you from bondage and sorrow [yOga sanjnitam] is called 'yoga'.
		</text>
		<text> [sa yOga:] This yoga [yOktavya:] is to be practiced [anirviNNa chEtasA] with enthusiasm, [nishchayEna] without doubt.
		</text>
		<text>



Yoga is the realization of your Self and its intimacy with
the Lord.
		</text>
		<text> It is a state of being.
		</text>
		<text>

By practicing realization,
the Self stays focused and enjoys unlimited joy.
		</text>
		<text> In this state of being, the
mind sees the Self and is satisfied in the Self alone, not being interested in
other things.
		</text>
		<text> It knows and experiences the ultimate contentment that can only be
grasped by realizing the Self.
		</text>
		<text> Such contentment is not grasped by the senses.
		</text>
		<text>

Situated in this state of being, we do not
move from the ultimate reality and the unlimited joys that come with the
realization of the Self.
		</text>
		<text> 

After reaching this state of being, our only
aim is to be focused on the Self and the Lord - we do not consider any other
benefit to be greater than this.
		</text>
		<text> In this state of being, even major events that
cause sorrow, such as the separation from a good son, do not shake us from our path.
		</text>
		<text>

Know this state of being by the name 'yoga'.
		</text>
		<text>
It frees us from our bondage to sorrow.
		</text>
		<text> Know this for sure while starting on
your quest.
		</text>
		<text> Practice it with enthusiasm.

Desires are of two types.
		</text>
		<text> The first type
comes out of contact with the material world - warmth, cold and so on.
		</text>
		<text> The
second type is born out of your wishes - such as the desire for a child or
territory.
		</text>
		<text> 

Only by relying on your true nature, you get
the ability to look beyond your wishes.
		</text>
		<text> Focus your mind on the fact that
there's no logical connection between those desires and your Self.
		</text>
		<text> 

Then, give up the limited happiness and
sorrow that arise out of unavoidable contact with the material world.
		</text>
		<text> Govern
the group of organs that form your body, even in the presence of all their
stimuli.

Little by little, you will let-go of things

Station the mind within the Self and don't be anxious about anything.

The person whose mind is at peace is the

With such focus, all your faults are

The word 'definitely' in this Shloka is
used to illustrate the cause and its effect.

		<text> In summary, a person in the quest
for the Self is able to keep away from materialistic passions, due to the fact
that the Self is pure and unlimited joy.

[yOga yuktAtmA]
A person who is firm in his quest for the Self [IkShatE] sees [AtmAnam]
himself [sarva bhUtastham] as
being present within every being, [cha] and [sarva bhUtAni]
all the beings [Atmani] in his
Self.
		</text>
		<text> [sarvatra samadarshana:]
He has an equal outlook everywhere.
		</text>
		<text>



The Self in you is
identical to the Self in every other being

A person who is immersed in work that is
independent of desire, who is committed to the realization of the Self,
sees that all beings including him have an identical form when they are
detached from the environment - A form, which is pure knowledge.
		</text>
		<text> All
differences observed are a manifestation of the environment.
		</text>
		<text> 

Thus, he sees the Self in everyone as being
equal, since the Self is pure knowledge when it is separated from the
environment.
		</text>
		<text> He sees his own Self situated in other beings and other beings
situated in his own Self.
		</text>
		<text> Meaning, he sees his own Self as having the same form
as all beings and the Self in all beings having an identical form as his own.
		</text>
		<text>
Seeing one Self is the same as seeing the Self in all beings, due to their
equivalence.
		</text>
		<text>

This is also expressed in other Shlokas,
such as (Chap.6#33): 'The state called yoga,
which was told by You as equanimity' and (Chap.5#19): 'When devoid of faults,
the Self in everyone is whole and complete'.

The characteristic of
every Self is identical to the Lord

Now, let's look at a person who has achieved
a more mature state of being.
		</text>
		<text> The Lord continues- Such a person gains those characteristics
that are similar to Me, as said in [munDaka upanishad], 3-1-3: 'a
person who is rid of faults will attain ultimate equality'.
		</text>
		<text>

In this way, the person sees the true
nature of the Self in everyone - separate from their good and bad deeds - as
being equivalent in nature to Me.
		</text>
		<text> In this way, he sees Me in every Self and
sees all of them being present in Me.
		</text>
		<text> 

Due to the fact that all of them are
equivalent, he sees one Self and looks at all of the others as being similar to
it.
		</text>
		<text> He has realized the true nature of his Self.
		</text>
		<text> By virtue of being equivalent
in nature to Me, I will never go out of his sight.
		</text>
		<text> 

As for Me, of course, I keep seeing Myself
- and due to the equality mentioned before, I keep seeing this person as being
equivalent to Me.
		</text>
		<text> I do not let him out of My sight.
		</text>
		<text>

Next, he describes a state of being that is
even more mature than this one:

unlimited knowledge.

The Self in every being, including
ourselves, has a single form - that of pure and unrestricted knowledge.

equanimity.

These 'feelings' could be happiness such as
the birth of a son, and sadness such as his death.
		</text>
		<text> This person considers them
equally, as they are not related to him.

death of his own son to be equal to the birth and death of another's son.

[arjuna uvAcha] Arjuna said [madhusUdhana] Krishna, [chanchalatvAt] due to the mind being volatile, [aham na

ayam yOga:] this yoga, which was [tvayA sAmyEna prOkta:] told by you as
equanimity, [Etasya sthirAm sthitim] as a state with any stability.
		</text>
		<text>

[kr`shNa] Krishna, [mana:]
the mind [chanchalam hi] is
indeed unstable.
		</text>
		<text> [balavat] As
if by force, [pramAthi] it
causes diversions [dhr`Dham]
that are very strong.
		</text>
		<text> [aham manyE] I am of the opinion that [suduShkaram] it is extremely difficult [tasya nigraham] to gain control over it, [vAyOriva] just as it is difficult to gain control over the wind.
		</text>
		<text>



Is such a state of
being really possible?

Arjuna said- For a long time, the mind has
experienced a wide variety of beings, based on the differences between humans,
differences between our Self, the Lord and so on.
		</text>
		<text> Given the variety it has
encountered, I do not see a way in which the mind can be stationed firmly in
the idea of equality.
		</text>
		<text>

The idea of equality was illustrated by You
as the universal equivalence of all beings- All of them have a form that is
pure knowledge and are equivalent to the Lord's form, when they are not under
the influence of their past deeds.
		</text>
		<text> 

However, the mind has seen a wide variety
of humans and other beings.
		</text>
		<text> The mind is accustomed to reacting to the various
stimuli of the environment incessantly and is inherently volatile.
		</text>
		<text> Its entire
experience goes against this equivalence.
		</text>
		<text> Hence, it is not possible for a
person to make it stand in one place.
		</text>
		<text> 

This mind will divert the person by force
and firmly drive him elsewhere.
		</text>
		<text> Even among the stimuli he is used to, the mind
cannot stay at one thought - it keeps wandering.
		</text>
		<text> Moreover, the Self has
qualities that are opposite to the usual stimuli experienced by the mind.
		</text>
		<text> 

Given all this, an attempt to make it stand
still in the Self is like controlling an unfavorable strong wind with a small
fan.
		</text>
		<text> It is extremely difficult, if not impossible.
		</text>
		<text>

In this way, a desire to know the means to
control the mind is expressed.

[asamyatAtmanA] Someone who doesn't&#8203; have his mind under control [duShTrApa] would find it impossible [yOgO] to pursue the Self - [iti mE mati:] this is my opinion.
		</text>
		<text> [tu] While [avAptum shakya:] this is achievable [vashyAtmanA] by a person who has control, [yatatA] who perseveres [upAyata:] according to the described methods.
		</text>
		<text>



Your intention to drive
lets you stay in the state of yoga.
		</text>
		<text>

Lord Krishna replies- No doubt, the mind is
difficult to control.
		</text>
		<text> It wanders constantly by its very nature.
		</text>
		<text> Even then, it
can be brought under control by the excellence of the Self - which results from
the practice of its pure form and qualities.
		</text>
		<text> 

Moreover, attachment to things other than
the Self leads to bondage.
		</text>
		<text> With this awareness, we get rid of the thirst for
various desires.
		</text>
		<text> With this and a little effort from the intellect, the mind can
be brought under our grip.
		</text>
		<text> 

The pursuit of the Self is indeed
impossible - even with very heavy effort - if the mind is not under control.
		</text>
		<text> A
person needs to bring his mind under control, persevering by the methods
described before- being aware of the Self, working independent of desire
to worship Me.
		</text>
		<text> 

With this, he gains the ability to practice
yoga.
		</text>
		<text> He gains the ability to see everything
with equanimity.
		</text>
		<text>

Next, Arjuna requests to understand the
greatness of yoga in its true nature, in the
manner described in Chap.2#40: 'While working without attachment towards outcomes,
something that has been started is not destroyed'.
		</text>
		<text> Over there, The Lord stated
that the preferred means to realization is the technique of working
without being driven.
		</text>
		<text> The knowledge of the Self is embedded in it.
		</text>
		<text> This
greatness is the same as the special state of
being described in this chapter.

[arjuna uvAcha] Arjuna said: [kr`ShNa] Krishna, [shraddhayOpEtO] a person with the best intentions and sufficient dedication [ayati:] without perseverance and proper
efforts [yOgAt chalita mAnasa:]
will have his mind wander from the path of realizing the Self.
		</text>
		<text> [aprApya yOga samsiddhim] Without attaining
the goal of realizing the Self, [kAm gatim gachChati] what will be his state?

[kachchit na nashyati] Will he not go wasted, [ubhaya vibhraShTa:] being ineffective on both sides, [ChinnAbhramiva] like a small piece of cloud that gets separated from a big
thunder-cloud? [apratiShThO] He
would have nothing to rest on, [brahmaNa: pathi
vimUDha:] having deviated from the path of realizing
the Self and the Lord.
		</text>
		<text>

[kr`ShNa] O Krishna, [Etam mE samshayam] this is my doubt! [arhasi] You have the ability [ChEttum] to get rid of it [ashEShata:] completely.
		</text>
		<text> [tvadanya:] Other than You, [na upapadyatE hi] there is indeed nobody [asya samShayasya
ChEttA] who can get rid of this doubt.
		</text>
		<text>



What if my intention
breaks?

Even though a person pursues the knowledge
of the Self in full faith, his mind may wander from the path of
Self-realization due to imperfections in the intensity of his efforts.
		</text>
		<text> Without
gaining the goal of realizing the Self, what state will he fall into? Just as a
fragment of cloud that has separated from a huge thunder-cloud perishes in the
midst of the sky, without being able to reach any other cloud, will he not
perish too? 

How would it be, to lose out on both
counts? On one side, he has deviated from the path shown by the Lord, to
realize the Self.
		</text>
		<text> On the other, he is not interested in being driven by the
usual pleasures and goals of this world.
		</text>
		<text> He is also not interested in the outcome
of his actions.
		</text>
		<text> He doesn't seem to thrive in achieving material goals.
		</text>
		<text>

In this way, it appears that he has no base
to rest upon.
		</text>
		<text> Having proceeded on the path of realizing the Self, he has
slipped and fallen.
		</text>
		<text> Deprived of both, will he perish? Or will he not? 

You are capable of cutting this doubt away
totally.
		</text>
		<text> By Your very nature, You see everything simultaneously at all times.
		</text>
		<text>
Other than You, there is nobody who can get rid of this doubt.

Don't worry; your
intention is never destroyed

A person who has begun the journey to
realize the Self may slip from the path, though he has complete faith.
		</text>
		<text> There is
no destruction for him here or anywhere else.
		</text>
		<text> The word 'destruction' includes
the loss of enjoyment of material goals, missing the experience of the Self
that we seek, as well as the onset of any unfavorable events.
		</text>
		<text> 

This kind of destruction will not befall a
person who has faith in the goal but has slipped from the path.
		</text>
		<text> The performance
of yoga is the most virtuous deed.
		</text>
		<text> Any
person who practices yoga will definitely
not end up in misfortune, in any of the three time-spans (the past, in his
present or in the future).

He lives there for a long time, till his

this birth (mentioned in the previous two Shlokas), [labhatE] he will regain [tam buddhisamOgam] the same knowledge of
the Self, [paurva daihikam] as
he had in his previous body.

		<text> [tata:] Then, [yatatE samsiddhau] he strives for realizing the Self [bhUya:] with greater strength.

[sa:]

Born in this way, he gains back the
knowledge of the Self, which was associated with his previous body.
		</text>
		<text> Then,
similar to a person waking up from sleep, he pursues this knowledge with even
greater perseverance.
		</text>
		<text> He pursues the path of realizing the Self in such a way,
that obstacles do not put him off anymore.

		<text> 

Worship of the Lord has been his virtue.
		</text>
		<text> He
worships by working independent of desire.

		<text> Having begun his quest to realize
the Self, this person may slip from the path of realizing the Self.

[yO mAm bhatatE] The person who worships Me, [madgatEna

We spoke about
realizing the Self within us.
		</text>
		<text> What about its intimacy with the Lord?

In this Shloka, the Lord says that the
people described till now pale in comparison with a person who surrenders to
Him.
		</text>
		<text> This person is not one among them; he's in a different league.
		</text>
		<text>

To understand this commentary, it is
necessary to know the usage of the various grammatical cases.
		</text>
		<text> The [panchamI] case means 'in comparison to',
which denotes that the subject is distinct from the objects being compared.
		</text>
		<text> The
[ShaShThI] case means
'among', which means the subject is one among the objects mentioned.
		</text>
		<text> In this
Shloka, the person being described is different from others.
		</text>
		<text> We must pick up
the 'in comparison to' case, not the 'one among the others' case.
		</text>
		<text>

The Shloka describes a person, different
from all others who persevere to realize the Self.
		</text>
		<text> This description uses the
ablative case (which means a comparison and separation - the [panchami vibhakti]) to denote all the
others.
		</text>
		<text> 

People who persevere to realize the Self
were described at progressive stages of maturity, starting with Chap.6#26 till
Chap.6#30.
		</text>
		<text> The person who is going to be described now is distinct from all
these four types.
		</text>
		<text> 

The genitive case (denoting 'belongingness'
- the [ShaShThI vibhakti]) is
not used, since this person is not merely a special one among others.
		</text>
		<text> The
phrase 'even in comparison to all those who persevere to realize the Self' has
been used in this Shloka.
		</text>
		<text> The word 'all' over here includes the people who
perform penance and the others mentioned previously (Chap.4#28).
		</text>
		<text> Even here, the
[panchamI] case is to be
grasped, by the same logic mentioned before- the practitioner who is going to
be described now has focused his mind the most.
		</text>
		<text> He is distinct in comparison to
all those people.
		</text>
		<text>

In comparison to this person, the
distinction between people mentioned previously (Chap.4#28) is insignificant.
		</text>
		<text>
It is like comparing a fabulous mountain in the Himalaya and a minute mustard
seed.
		</text>
		<text> Even though the mustard seeds have a perceptible difference and
inequality among themselves, their insignificance is obvious when placed in
perspective with the mountain.
		</text>
		<text>

This person has placed himself in Me by
extreme affection and with the conviction that there is no protector other than
Me.
		</text>
		<text> This person worships Me with strong intent and a sense of urgency to attain
me, since he cannot tolerate even a moment of separation from Me - again, by an
overload of affection towards Me.
		</text>
		<text> 

'Me' refers to Lord Krishna, whose playing
field is the creation, evolution and destruction of the entire universe, which
is endowed with a variety of things that are to be experienced, various species
of beings that experience it, things that help in experiencing it and places
where it can be experienced.
		</text>
		<text> 

This is The Lord, whom no flaw can
influence, who is an abode of unlimited amount of great knowledge, power,
wealth, courage, strength, brilliance and uncountable other auspicious
qualities, whose form is exactly the way He wishes, a form that is unthinkable
in its entirety - divine, extraordinary, eternal, flawless, with limitless brilliance,
beauty, aroma, tenderness, charm, youthfulness and is an abode to infinite such
qualities.
		</text>
		<text> 

His form and nature cannot be broken-down
and understood either through speech or thought.
		</text>
		<text> He is a vast ocean of
compassion, character, affection, generosity and protects all beings of the
universe without exception, without regard to any of their peculiarities.
		</text>
		<text> 

He takes away the pain from anyone who bows
and submits to Him.
		</text>
		<text> He is a sea of affection to them.
		</text>
		<text> He is not visible to any
human and never moves away from his true nature.
		</text>
		<text> 

This is Krishna, who has taken birth in the
house of Vasudeva, who brightens the world with his continuous and unsurpassed brilliance,
who fills the universe with his splendor - is the kind of Lord worshipped by
this person.
		</text>
		<text>

Lord Krishna concludes this chapter- I, the
Lord who always brings everything everywhere into realization in its true form,
consider this person to be the most focused, the best of the best among all
beings.

		<h1name>Chapter 7</h1name>

		<link>Chapter%207.html</link>
		<text>Chapter 7

In the first volume (Chapter 1 to Chapter
6), Lord Krishna described the way to realize the Self.
		</text>
		<text> This realization is an
accessory in the service of the Lord.
		</text>
		<text> It is achieved by working purely as worship
to the Lord, without being driven by desire.
		</text>
		<text> Such work has the knowledge of the
Self embedded in it.
		</text>
		<text> 

Worship is the means to reach Lord
Narayana, who is always present with Lakshmi, who alone is the creator of the
universe, who is flawless, who knows everything, who is present in all beings,
whose will is always realized, who pervades everything and is beyond the
perception of our sense organs.
		</text>
		<text> 

Till now, the true nature of the Self,
along with the means to realize it was described to be able to explain the
worship of the Lord.
		</text>
		<text>

In this middle volume (chapter 7 to chapter
12) the nature of the Supreme Lord and His worship, also called bhakti,
are described.
		</text>
		<text> Several testimonies from the scriptures describe this
worship, starting with:

Chap.18#46: Any human being attains the
goal by worshipping The Lord with his own work.
		</text>
		<text>

Chap.18#54: Having realized the Self, with
a serene mind, he doesn't get upset and doesn't yearn.
		</text>
		<text> Such a person has
equanimity among all beings.
		</text>
		<text> He attains the ultimate devotion to Me.
		</text>
		<text>

These two Shlokas summarized the
achievement of devotion.
		</text>
		<text>

Service to the Lord can be a means to
achieve Him, only when it takes the form of devotion - as stated in the following
sentences of the Vedanta:

[shvetAshvatara
upanishat],
3-8: 'A person overcomes the cycle of deaths only by
knowing Him'

[purusha
sUkta]: 'Knowing Him alone, a person attains moksha'

And further:

[br`hadAraNyaka
upanishat],
4-5-6: 'The Self must be seen - it must be realized
through focused attention'

[br`hadAraNyaka
upanishat],
1-4-15: 'We must perform worship by keeping the Lord as
the goal'

[ChandOgya
upanishat],
7-26-2: Once purified (from desire, anger and
laziness), we think of the Lord constantly.
		</text>
		<text> By meeting the memory of the
Lord, we are freed from all things that mislead us.
		</text>
		<text> Then we will achieve moksha.
		</text>
		<text> 

[muMDaka], 2-2-8: Be it a great being or a lowly creature, when it sees The Lord, it
loses all its past deeds.
		</text>
		<text> The enemies of the Self (desire and hatred)
will be destroyed.
		</text>
		<text> All doubts and suspicions are driven out.
		</text>
		<text>

In this way, all of these statements convey
a single meaning - what we call variously as meditation and worship is an
unbroken chain of thought, which is equivalent to seeing the Lord.
		</text>
		<text>

Further, it is stated in the [kaTha upanishat, 2-23]:
This Self and the Lord are not achievable by instruction, not by thought, not
even by hearing a lot about them.
		</text>
		<text> The person who is blessed by the Lord alone
will attain the Lord.
		</text>
		<text> The Lord will show himself to this person.
		</text>
		<text>

Worship
is an uninterrupted chain of thought

By the emphasis laid here, we see that
worship is the uninterrupted chain of thought, which makes a person obtain the
blessings of the Lord.
		</text>
		<text> Since the object of worship is so adorable, the chain of
thought called worship itself is lovely.
		</text>
		<text> 

Devotion is to worship
with friendship

This is called bhakti: 'When the
uninterrupted chain of thought is filled with friendship, it is called bhakti'
-as stated in [laingapurANa,uttarabhAga:].
		</text>
		<text>

Further, there are more statements in the
scriptures that convey the same meaning:

The [puruSha sUkta] says: 'By knowing Him alone, a person attains moksha.
		</text>
		<text> There is no
other way to the goal'

Chap.11#53, Chap.11#54: The Lord says
through these Shlokas: 'Not through the Vedas, not even by penance, not by
donating things, not by performing sacrifice - it is not possible to see Me in
the way that you do.
		</text>
		<text> Arjuna, through devotion alone, it is possible to know Me
like this, to see Me in My true form and finally go into Me.

Here, the seventh chapter describes the
true form of Lord, who is to be worshipped in this way.
		</text>
		<text> It describes that the
Lord's form is concealed by the environment ('environment' includes
our body).
		</text>
		<text> It speaks about seeking refuge in the Lord to shake off this
ignorance.
		</text>
		<text> Then, the four types of people who render service to the Lord are described
along with the special characteristics of those who know.

[shrI bhagavAnuvAcha] The Lord said:

[pArtha] Arjuna, [shr'Nu]
listen [tat yatha] to the way
in which [mAm jnAsyasi] you
will know me [samagram]
entirely [asamshayam] without
any doubt, [mayi Asakta manA:]
with a mind filled with eagerness towards Me, [yOgam
yunjan] embarking on the journey to join Me, [madAshraya:] having taken refuge in Me



Awareness of the Lord's
uniqueness generates affection towards Him

The Lord continues- The mind focuses on Me
with an eagerness that comes from a strong wish to attain Me.
		</text>
		<text> As soon as you
realize the uniqueness of My great powers, My true nature, My qualities and My
activities, you will be swept off your senses by a rush of love towards Me.
		</text>
		<text> By
this love, you will deeply bind your thoughts in Me.
		</text>
		<text>

Then you take refuge in Me - you cannot
exist without Me; In this way, I alone am your refuge and the basis for your existence.
		</text>
		<text>
You will embark on the journey to join me and be of my service.
		</text>
		<text> Listen to the
knowledge that I am going to tell you with an attentive mind.
		</text>
		<text> After I tell
this, you will know Me entirely without any doubt.

[tE aham vakShyAmi] I will now tell you [idam jnAnam] this knowledge [sa vijnAnam] along with the ability to distinguish, [ashEShata] in completeness.
		</text>
		<text> [yat jnAtvA] After knowing this [na anyat] there is nothing else, [avashiShyatE iha] which remains over here [jnAtavyam] to be learnt [bhUya:] any more.
		</text>
		<text>



I will now teach you about Me, along with the
knowledge required to distinguish Me.
		</text>
		<text> I will not leave out anything about the
subject.
		</text>
		<text> The 'knowledge required to distinguish' is about knowing those
qualities that make Me distinct - the way in which I differ from the variety of
conscious beings and non-conscious things - everything other than Me.
		</text>
		<text>

My distinction is by virtue of being the destroyer
of all impurity, by having countless varieties of favorable qualities in
limitless amounts with no boundaries and by having an unending set of great
powers.
		</text>
		<text>

Along with the knowledge about this
distinction, I will tell you the knowledge about My true nature.
		</text>
		<text> There wouldn't
be any need to elaborate further.
		</text>
		<text> After knowing this, there is nothing to be
learnt about Me anymore.
		</text>
		<text>

Next, the Lord illustrates the great
difficulty involved in knowing.

Our understanding comes
from breakdown and analysis.

we bring Him into our thoughts?

As said in Chap.7#19: 'Such a great person
is extremely difficult to find'; In Chap.7#26: 'There isn't anyone who knows Me'.

[upadhAraya]
Bear in mind that [sarvANi bhUtAni] all beings [Etat yOnIni] owe their existence to the two natures.
		</text>
		<text> [tathA] In this way, [aham]
I am [prabhava: pralaya:] the
creator and the destroyer [kr'tsnasya jagata:] of the entire universe.
		</text>
		<text>



I am an aggregate of these conscious and
non-conscious beings.
		</text>
		<text> Know that all beings, right from the gods down to minute organisms and inanimate
objects belong to Me.
		</text>
		<text> They appear to be higher and lower life forms.
		</text>
		<text> They are a
combination of things that have the ability to perceive and things that don't.
		</text>
		<text>
My two natures are the basis of their existence (two natures of the Lord are:
The material nature described in Chap.7#4 and the conscious nature described in
Chap.7#5).
		</text>
		<text> Since they have My two
natures as the basis of their existence, they definitely belong to Me.
		</text>
		<text> 

In fact, the entire universe has My two natures as the basis for its
existence.
		</text>
		<text> My two natures in turn
have Me as the basis for their existence.
		</text>
		<text> By this fact, and by the fact that
everything belongs to Me, know that I alone am the birth of the entire
universe, I alone am its destruction and I alone am its controller.
		</text>
		<text> 

This fact -
that the Lord is the basis for all of nature's beings, all of them being an
aggregation of things that perceive and things that don't - is established by
statements in the scriptures:

[subAla], 2: The gross
elements perish and settle in the subtle.
		</text>
		<text> The subtle rests in enlightenment.
		</text>
		<text>
Enlightenment rests in darkness.
		</text>
		<text> Darkness becomes one with the Supreme Lord.
		</text>
		<text>

[viShNu
purANa],
1-2-24: From Lord Vishnu's form, there arise two forms
- the supreme and the subject beings.
		</text>
		<text>

[viShNu
purANa],
6-4-30,31: The nature that was described by Me, in both
its gross and subtle forms, along with the subject beings perish into the Supreme
Lord.
		</text>
		<text> The Supreme Lord is the basis for the existence of every being and is the
ultimate controller.
		</text>
		<text> The Supreme Lord, known by the name of Vishnu, is praised
by verses in the Vedas and Vedanta.
		</text>
		<text>

These were some of the scriptures
describing the relation of the universe to the Lord.

[dhananjaya]
Arjuna, [na asti kinchit] there

The word [para] means 'beyond', in the sense of being the basis of existence or the
controller.
		</text>
		<text> For instance, gravitation is a basis of planetary motion and
controls the path of movement.
		</text>
		<text> So, an understanding of gravity lies 'beyond'
the understanding of planetary motion.
		</text>
		<text> In this Shloka, the Lord states that He
has no other basis or controller.
		</text>
		<text>

My two
natures are the basis of existence.
		</text>
		<text> I am the basis of their existence.
		</text>
		<text> By
virtue of being the controller of the very consciousness that controls all
conscious beings, I am the ultimate basis of everything.

		<text> Further, I am the
ultimate in having the qualities of knowledge, strength and power.

[idam sarvam] All
of this [prOtam] is mounted [mayi] in Me [iva] just as [maNigaNA]
beads are strung [sUtrE] in a
string,



All entities of this universe are made from
combinations of the conscious and non-conscious.
		</text>
		<text> They are in activity and cause
other activities.
		</text>
		<text> They exist as though they were My body.
		</text>
		<text> Like a set of beads
on a string, they have Me as the core of their Self.
		</text>
		<text> They have Me as their
abode.
		</text>
		<text> 

The fact that the universe exists as the
body of the Lord, who is its owner and controller, who is situated inside
everything, is given by the following references:

[br'hadArAnyaka], 3-7-3: The one, for whom the earth is His body

[br'hadArAnyaka], 3-7-22: The one, for whom our Self is His body

[subAla], 7:
He is inside every being, destroys all faults, is divine and unique - He is
Narayana.
		</text>
		<text>

In this way, the universe with all its
beings exists as the body of the Lord.
		</text>
		<text> The Lord is situated inside everything
as the Self inside the body.
		</text>
		<text> 

Everything is a form of the Lord and the
Lord exists in every form - since everything is His body and He is the ultimate
Self.
		</text>
		<text> He continues in the following Shlokas, stating that everything relates to
Him - that He is the one addressed by all words.

All these thoughts and feelings, having

You get the point, so there's no need of further
enumeration.
		</text>

All thoughts and feelings having the three qualities of wisdom, passion and ignorance
make up experiences, the sense organs and the body.
		</text>
		<text> Know that all of them come
into being from Me.

By virtue of being My body, know that they

Similarly, the Universe exists for the Lord's enjoyment.

In us, the Self is in a state wherein it can receive favors from the body.

[mOhitam] Being
deluded [Ebhi: bhAvai:] by
these ways of thinking and feeling [tribhi: guNamayai:] that are pervaded by the three
qualities, [sarvam idam jagat] this whole world [nAbhijAnAti] does not know [mAm]
Me, [Ebhya: param] who is above
them, [avyayam] who stays
unchanged.
		</text>
		<text>



As
described before, the entire universe belongs to Me, consisting of conscious
and non-conscious elements.
		</text>
		<text> The universe periodically comes into being from Me.
		</text>
		<text>
At the time of its destruction, it comes back to rest in Me.
		</text>
		<text> It is sustained in
Me alone.
		</text>
		<text> It is situated as though it were My body, having Me as its owner.
		</text>
		<text> 

In this way, I am present as all different
things in this universe - as the cause and origin, as well as the resulting manifestation.
		</text>
		<text>

In this way, I am the basis of existence
and the controller.
		</text>
		<text> I have unbounded knowledge and count-less other favorable qualities.
		</text>
		<text>
I am above and beyond in all ways.
		</text>
		<text> There is nobody else who is beyond My
auspicious qualities.
		</text>
		<text> Situated in this way, having unique favorable qualities
and ways to enjoy them, I am above all thoughts and feelings that are pervaded
by the three qualities of sattva, rajas
and tamas.
		</text>
		<text> 

Here, the phrase 'I am above all thoughts
and feelings' means that the Lord is beyond those qualities, without being worn
out by them, always having an undisturbed, constant form.
		</text>
		<text>

This entire universe is deluded by material
things that are pervaded by the three qualities.
		</text>
		<text>
These material things are very unpleasant and short-lived.
		</text>
		<text> They exist to be
experienced by our body and sense organs in accordance with past deeds.
		</text>
		<text> Being
deluded in this way, the world, with its gods,
animals, humans and inanimate things, does not know Me.
		</text>
		<text>

Why do we pursue constrained
happiness?

Now comes the question: With You (the Lord)
being ever-present, being superior to all material enjoyments by Your very
nature, being with uninterrupted joy in large amounts, with an eternal and
undisturbed form, how come every conscious being intends to enjoy the limited
pleasures of the material world? Especially considering that material
experiences are pervaded by the three qualities,
are short-lived and are very unpleasant?

[EShA] These [mama daivI mAyA] divine creations of Mine [guNamayI] are pervaded by the three qualities.
		</text>
		<text> [duratyayA
hi] They are indeed impossible to cross over.
		</text>
		<text>



These material creations are 'divine'
because they are created by the Lord for the Lord's entertainment.
		</text>
		<text> Due to this,
they are impossible to cross over.
		</text>
		<text> The word [mAyA] has been used over here to refer to the material creations we
perceive - including all unpleasant things - which drive us towards strange
activities.
		</text>
		<text> 

For instance, the word [mAyA] has been used thus in [vishNu purANa], 1-19-20: 

[tatO bhagavatA tasya rakShArtham
chakramuttamam |
		</text>
		<text> AjagAma samAjnaptam jvAlAmAli sudarshanam |
		</text>
		<text> tEna mAyAsahasram tat
shambarasya ashugAminA |
		</text>
		<text> bAlasya rakShatA dEham EkaikashyEna sUditam ||
		</text>
		<text> ]

Translated, it means: 'Then, being
instructed by the Lord, the unparalleled disk arrived to protect him (to
protect Pralhad).
		</text>
		<text> Each one of the thousands of creations and actions of the
wicked were destroyed by this quick-spinning weapon that is a blazing ring
known as Sudarshana, while protecting the boy'

Used in this way, the word [mAyA] does
not give the common meaning of 'illusion'.
		</text>
		<text> 

There are other contexts where this word is
used to denote 'magic', a certain spell or the effect of medicines.
		</text>
		<text> Since these
things make our mind to perceive various meanings, they are denoted by the word
[mAyA].
		</text>
		<text> If we were to take the common thread through all the usages of the
word [mAyA], even including the
meaning of 'illusion', they all influence the mind and the intellect.
		</text>
		<text> In this
way, it is complementary to the mind, creating impressions in it.
		</text>
		<text>

In the [shvEtAshvatara upanishat], 4-10, it is said - 'Know the environment around you as [mAyA], your experiences.
		</text>
		<text> Know the person
who owns this [mAyA] as the
Lord'.
		</text>
		<text> In this way, it is pervaded by the three
qualities, creates our experiences and belongs to the Lord.
		</text>
		<text> Its job is to conceal
the form of the Lord and trigger the intent to indulge in itself.
		</text>
		<text>

It isn't possible to
see beyond our cognition of this material world, unless we surrender to the
Lord.
		</text>
		<text>

Hence, being deluded by the Lord's material
creations, the beings of this world do not know the nature of the Lord, who has
a form that is limitless and unbroken joy.
		</text>
		<text>

Now The Lord describes the method to free
ourselves from the delusion brought about by material experiences -



[

mAmEva
yE prapadyantE mAyAmEtAm taranti tE || 14 ||
		</text>
		<text>

]





[yE] The people
who [prapadyantE] surrender [mAmEva] exclusively to Me [tE taranti] - they will cross over [EtAm mAyAm] this material world.
		</text>
		<text>



I am The Lord whose intent is always
fulfilled.
		</text>
		<text> I am extremely kind, the refuge of the entire universe.
		</text>
		<text> I provide
refuge without considering any special qualities of anyone.
		</text>
		<text> Those who surrender
and take refuge in Me alone will cross over My material world that's pervaded
by the three qualities.
		</text>
		<text> Being freed from
material experiences, they render service to Me alone.
		</text>
		<text>

Now He explains why everyone does not
surrender to the Lord, even though such surrender would bring them the reward
of adoring the Lord and being close to Him.

People who do not value virtue [mUDhA:] are ignorant.
		</text>
		<text> [na mAm prapadyantE] They do not take refuge in Me.
		</text>
		<text> [narAdhamA:] Even though they consider Me to be ordinary, they do not approach
Me.
		</text>
		<text> [mAyayA apahr'ta jnAnA:]
The material world and its perceptions have stolen awareness in them.
		</text>
		<text> [asuram bhAvam AshritA:] Yet others know
about My vast powers, possessions and My knowledge, but that only builds
jealousy and hatred towards Me.
		</text>
		<text>



People who do not value virtue are those
who commit vile deeds - they do not take refuge in Me.
		</text>
		<text> They come in four types,
going by the deeds they committed in the past:

1.
		</text>
		<text>
People who do not know

2.
		</text>
		<text>
Those who know and still waste their human birth

3.
		</text>
		<text>
Whose knowledge is stolen by material
perceptions

4.
		</text>
		<text>
Those who are consumed by jealousy and hatred

Let's examine each category:

People in the first category - Those who do
not know - have knowledge that is misleading.
		</text>
		<text> Their misunderstanding tells them
that the Self and their experiences exist in their service, for their purpose.
		</text>
		<text>
However, as described before, the Self and the environment exist primarily in
the Lord's service - that is their true nature.
		</text>
		<text>

People in the second category - Those who
know and still waste their awareness - They know My character in the usual way
(by reading and listening, for instance).
		</text>
		<text> Even then, they do not
approach Me.
		</text>
		<text>

People in the third category have their
knowledge stolen by material perceptions.
		</text>
		<text> Though they've been told about Me and
My possessions, their awareness has been stolen by false logic, which tries to
prove that anything that's not perceptible in this material world is not real.
		</text>
		<text>

People in the final category know me well
and also know of My vast possessions.
		</text>
		<text> However, this knowledge only serves to
trigger jealousy and hatred in them.
		</text>
		<text>

This was the list of people in the
increasing order of vile deeds committed.

ArtO
jijnAsu: arthArthI jnAnI cha bharatarShabha || 16 ||
		</text>
		<text>

]





[bharatarShabha arjuna] Arjuna, [chaturvidhA] four types of [sukr'tina: janA:] virtuous people [mAm bhajantE] worship Me: [Arta:]
The distressed, who want to regain what they lost, [jijnAsu:] those who are curious, [arthArthI] those who want to acquire wealth [jnAnI
cha] and those who know.
		</text>
		<text>



We have different
objectives and we surrender to the Lord accordingly

'Virtuous people' are those who, by their
virtuous deeds, have taken refuge in Me and worship Me alone.
		</text>
		<text> Due to
differences in their deeds, they are grouped into four categories.
		</text>
		<text> 

These
categories of virtuous people will be described now.
		</text>
		<text> Due to great deeds
performed, those described later in the list have distinguished knowledge and
are hence special:

1.
		</text>
		<text>
Worshippers in the first category are those who
have lost their possessions and their fame.
		</text>
		<text> They desire to have it back. 

2.
		</text>
		<text>
The second category has people who desire wealth
that they don't have yet.
		</text>
		<text>

The difference
between the first and second category is only superficial.
		</text>
		<text> Since the objective
of both is to gain wealth, they get the same status.

3.
		</text>
		<text>
Worshippers in the third category are driven by curiosity.
		</text>
		<text>
They want to experience the Self, considering that the Self has a form that's
pure knowledge.

4.
		</text>
		<text>
Worshippers in the fourth category know the
nature of the Self - that it is under the service of the Lord, for His purpose
alone - as stated in the Shlokas beginning with Chap7#5: 'know this other
nature of Mine, which is the ultimate one'.
		</text>
		<text> They do not stop at merely
realizing the nature of the Self as being distinct from the environment.
		</text>
		<text> They
believe in the Lord Himself being the ultimate goal and strive to reach the
Lord.
		</text>
		<text> They are the wise ones 'who know'.
		</text>
		<text>

Know that the
Lord is the ultimate purpose.
		</text>
		<text> When we know this, we yearn for the Lord Himself.
		</text>
		<text>
To those of us who know the Lord, it doesn't make sense to yearn for wealth -
since the Lord is the purpose of any enjoyment that comes from it.
		</text>
		<text> It also
doesn't make sense to yearn for the bliss of the Self, since He is the purpose
of that enjoyment too.
		</text>
		<text> We yearn for the Lord for the Lord's sake.
		</text>
		<text> 

Those who
know this are the 'ones who know'.
		</text>
		<text>

[tEShAm] Among
them, [jnAnI] the one who knows, [nityayukta:] whose thoughts are always with Me, [Ekabhakti:] who is devoted to Me alone [vishiShyatE] is special.
		</text>
		<text> [aham]
I am [priya:] dear [jnAnina:] to this wise person, [atyartham hi] in a way that is entirely beyond
description.
		</text>
		<text> [sa:] He is [mama priya: cha] dear to Me as well.
		</text>
		<text>



Once we know the Lord,
other objectives seem insignificant

Among them, the one who
knows is special.
		</text>
		<text> He is always with the Lord and is devoted to the Lord
alone.
		</text>
		<text> As the Lord says - To the one who knows, I am the
only one he wants to achieve.
		</text>
		<text> This person has an eternal bond with Me.
		</text>
		<text> In case
of the other two types of people, the bond with Me lasts only till their
aspirations are met.
		</text>
		<text> Further, the one who knows is devoted
to Me alone, while the other two are devoted to Me by the achievement of their
desires.
		</text>
		<text>

Moreover, I am extremely dear to the one who knows.
		</text>
		<text> Here, the word 'extremely' has been used in
the sense of being 'beyond description'.
		</text>
		<text> This love is so great, it is beyond
description even to Me, the Lord who knows everything and has all capabilities.
		</text>
		<text>
This is because such Love does not have any limit.
		</text>
		<text> 

It is said of Pralhad in [vishNu purANa 1-17-39]:

[sattvasakta
mati: kr'ShNE dashyamAnO mahOragai: |
		</text>
		<text> na vivEdAtmanO gAtram tat smr'tya AhlAda
samsthita: ||
		</text>
		<text>]

It means - 'Pralhad, having his focus on
Lord Krishna alone, went without even noticing his body when he was being
bitten by huge snakes, since he was situated in the joy that is generated by
keeping the Lord in mind'

In the same way, he is dear to Me as well.

[EtE sarvE] All
of these people [udArA: Eva]
are definitely generous.
		</text>
		<text> [mE matam tu] However, I assert that [jnAnI] the one who knows [Atmaiva] is like Myself.
		</text>
		<text> [sa: yuktAtmA] His thoughts are always with Me.
		</text>
		<text> [mAm Eva
Asthita:] He believes and takes refuge in Me alone, [anuttamAm gatim] the supreme goal.
		</text>
		<text>



All four categories of people are generous
in the sense that they worship Me alone.
		</text>
		<text> They are very charitable.
		</text>
		<text> Whoever
takes even a small thing from Me, they are the ones who have given Me
everything.
		</text>
		<text> Even among them, I consider the one who knows
as Myself - I assume a form in which I (the Lord of the universe) owe
affectionate service to him.
		</text>
		<text>

Why is this so? That is because he has
sought refuge in Me, considering Me alone as the ultimate achievement, knowing
that without Me, his Self does not have any basis of existence.
		</text>
		<text>

Hence, there is no possibility for Me to
exist without him either.
		</text>
		<text> In this way, he is indeed My own self.

vAsudEva:
sarvam iti sa mahAtmA sudurlabha: || 19 ||
		</text>
		<text>

]





[antE] At the
end of [bahUnAm janmanAm] many
births, [jnAnavAn] a person who knows [prapadyatE] will surrender [mAm] to Me [vAsudEva: sarvam iti] with the conviction that Lord Krishna is everything.
		</text>
		<text> [sa: mahAtmA] Such a great person [sudurlabha:] is extremely difficult to
find.
		</text>
		<text>



This surrender,
which precedes the joy of being in the service the Lord and the joy of knowing
the true Self, is not the result of a small number of virtuous births.
		</text>
		<text> Indeed,
at the conclusion of many virtuous births, a person comes to know that his
primary source of joy is in being of service to Lord Krishna alone.
		</text>
		<text> 

From that point onwards, he comes to know
about his own nature, state of being and his activities.
		</text>
		<text> He gains knowledge
that the Lord is greater than all the countless great qualities put together.
		</text>
		<text>

Having gained such knowledge, he believes -
'Lord Krishna is the ultimate goal.
		</text>
		<text> He is also the means to arrive at that
goal.
		</text>
		<text> Though there are many other desires, the Lord Himself is all of that' -
With this conviction, he surrenders to Me and dedicates himself to My service.
		</text>
		<text>
This is a great person.
		</text>
		<text> Such people are hard to find in this world.
		</text>
		<text>

This is indeed the meaning of the phrase
'Lord Vasudeva is everything' - Starting with Chap7#17 'I am dear to this
knowledgeable person, in a way that is definitely beyond description'
and Chap7#18 'Keeping Me in his thoughts always, he considers Me as the
ultimate achievement and takes refuge in Me'.
		</text>
		<text> These Shlokas gave the
description of the one who knows.
		</text>
		<text>

The fact that all conscious and
non-conscious beings are two natures
of the Lord and exist in His service was illustrated starting with Chap7#4:
'This universe of mine is divided into eight categories: The solids, liquids,
gasses, energy, space, mind, the gross collections and the concept of
individuality' and in Chap7#5 'Know My ultimate nature as being distinct from
this universe - know My ultimate form as a conscious being by whom all this is
sustained'

Further, the dependence of these two natures on the Lord was
described, along with the dependence of all causes and effects, their form,
state of existence and their activities.
		</text>
		<text> This was stated starting with the
Shloka in Chap7#6 'I am the creator and the destroyer of the entire universe',
going on to Chap7#7 'There is absolutely nothing else that is superior to Me'
till Chap7#12  'Know that all these feelings, with the three qualities being prominent in them,
originate from Me.
		</text>
		<text> However, I am not bound in them.
		</text>
		<text> They are situated in Me' -
These Shlokas established the supremacy of the Lord in all ways and the
dependence of everything on Him.
		</text>
		<text>

The person who knows all this is termed as
'the one who knows'.
		</text>
		<text>

Again, the Lord emphasizes that the one who knows - the type of person described above - is very
rare.

[niyatA:] Being
controlled by [svayA prakr'tyA]

their knowledge having been taken [tai: tai: kAmai:] by various desires arising out of that nature, [prapadyantE] people take refuge [anya dEvatA:] in other powers [tam tam niyamam AsthAya] by following
various methods, in order to attain those desires.
		</text>
		<text>



All people of this world are led by the
influence of their own nature, which take the form of 'feelings' that are
pervaded by the three qualities.
		</text>
		<text> The knowledge
about My form has been abducted by desires that have the three qualities prominent in them.
		</text>
		<text> In order to
satisfy those desires, they seek refuge in powers other than Me.
		</text>
		<text> They follow
various methods to please others - methods that go against their 'true nature'.
		</text>

Our true nature is to
be of service to the Lord alone.

Which ever devotee [architum ichChati] likes to please [yAm yAm tanum] what ever form [shraddhayA] with dedication, [vidadhAmi aham] I give [achalAm]
stability [tAmEva] to the same [shraddhAm] faith [tasya

		</text>
		<text>



Even these sources of power are indeed My
body, existing for My purpose.
		</text>
		<text> This is stated in the scriptures such as [br'hadAranyka upanishad], 3-7-9: 'The One who sits in the Sun; The One whom the Sun does not know;
The One, for whose utility the Sun exists'

People who worship those powers will want
to do so with faith and dedication, without knowing that they exist for My
purpose alone.
		</text>
		<text> Even though these worshippers are unaware that all powers are
Mine, I take consideration of the fact that their dedication is towards My
body.
		</text>
		<text> Hence, I bring stability to their dedication - meaning, I remove the
obstacles in their way.

		</text>
		<text> [mayA Eva vihitAn] These desires are given by Me alone.
		</text>
		<text>



In this Shloka, the phrase 'With that
dedication' refers to the dedication that is stabilized by the Lord by removing
all obstacles.
		</text>
		<text> With such dedication, the person desires to adore and worship a
source of power.
		</text>
		<text> Since all sources of power are analogous to My body, since
they exist in My service, the person obtains the desires he wished for - they
are given by Me alone.
		</text>
		<text>

Dedication to a cause
is dedication to the Lord

This person may not know that those other
powers are like My body, when he worships them.
		</text>
		<text> Hence, he doesn't even know
that such worship is actually a service to Me.
		</text>
		<text> Even then, I give him what he
desires - since it is worship that's rendered to Me in reality.

People with little knowledge will worship
various sources of power that can satisfy their desires.

		<text> However, any outcome
from such worship is minor and short-lived.
		</text>
		<text> How come?

Your outcomes are as
temporary as you intend

All powers other than the Lord have a
finite life span.
		</text>
		<text> Hence, a person who aspires to a position of power will
obtain the same - but that position is short-lived and will be destroyed.
		</text>
		<text> The
person will start again in a different form.
		</text>
		<text> 

My devotees too involve in the same
activities, considering them as a way to adore and worship Me.
		</text>
		<text> Having given up
the addiction to temporary results, My adoration alone is their primary goal.
		</text>
		<text>
In this way, they will attain Me.
		</text>
		<text> They do not need to start again.
		</text>
		<text> It is said
clearly in Chap8#16: 'Arjuna, after attaining Me, there is no rebirth'.

opportunity to seek refuge in the Lord when He takes birth, for instance as a
human.

I am the Lord of everything, who is

		</text>
		<text> I am born with affection towards those

		</text>
		<text> I am born without abandoning my true nature.

Most people don't
recognize Krishna as the permanent enjoyer of everything

People who are incapable of discerning
don't know My true nature of being supreme, of having nobody superior to Me and
of being unchanged.

		<text> They equate Me to a prince in this world.

		<text> They think that I

They do not worship Me with their actions.

I know all beings that existed in the past,

in this Shloka: 'there isn't anyone who knows Me' - Conscious beings exist in

[bhArata] Arjuna,
[parantapa] the destroyer of
enemies, [sarva bhUtAni] all
beings [sammOham yAnti] get the
state of ignorance [sargE] at
the time of their birth [dvandva mOhEna] due to the delusion brought on by the dualities in Nature, [ichChA dvESha samutthEna] which arises out
of desire and aversion.
		</text>
		<text>



Ignorance and
pre-occupation with life's dualities are part of our characteristics

All beings get into a state of ignorance at
birth itself, being within dualities like heat and cold.
		</text>
		<text> This ignorance is generated
by desires and aversions.
		</text>
		<text> 

To
elaborate: Dualities such as happiness and sorrow have the three qualities in them.
		</text>
		<text> All conscious beings
have practiced feelings of desire and aversion towards various subjects in
previous births.
		</text>
		<text> Due to their influence, beings are born with ignorance, with
the same dualities (like heat and cold) becoming the subject of their
desires and aversions.
		</text>
		<text> 

With ignorance, these beings get deluded -
desire and aversion towards various subjects becomes their character, instead
of experiencing the joy of being together with Me or the sorrow of being
without Me.
		</text>
		<text> 

The person who knows,
on the other hand, experiences only the joy of being with Me and the sorrow of
being without Me.
		</text>
		<text> Nobody is born with that character.

[tu] However, [puNyakarmaNam janAnAm] people who have done
virtuous things, [yEShAm pApam]
whose vile deeds [antagatam]
have come to an end [tE dvandva mOha nirmuktA:] get freed from the ignorance that's in the form of the dualities we experience [mAm
bhajantE] and worship Me [dr'DhavratA:] with firm resolve.
		</text>
		<text>



While everyone is born
with delusion, how do some of us end up knowing the Lord?

Misfortune trails everyone over many cycles
of births and deaths, causing desire and aversion towards the dualities of Nature.
		</text>
		<text> It prevents them from
looking up to Me by suppressing their natural inclination to be with Me.
		</text>
		<text> 

In a few people, this misfortune has come
to an end due to virtue that's accumulated over many lives.
		</text>
		<text> These people take
refuge in Me in different ways, in-line with their virtues as described before
in Chap.7#16.
		</text>
		<text> They get free from the delusions of the three qualities.
		</text>
		<text> They resolve to worship Me alone
- for freedom from infirmity and death, for great wealth or to attain Me.
		</text>
		<text>

The Lord described four types of people in Chap.7#16: 'Four types of
virtuous people worship Me: The distressed who want to regain what they lost,
those who are curious, those who want to acquire wealth and those who know'.
		</text>
		<text> The
first and third are similar, since they crave wealth.
		</text>
		<text> So, the next Shlokas
refer to them as 'three' types of people: Those who are curious to realize the
imperishable Self, those who seek material wealth and those who know.
		</text>
		<text>

Now, The Lord describes the specialties that
are to be known and practiced by the three types of people who worship the
Lord.

[mAm Ashritya]
Having taken My refuge, [yE] those
who [yatanti] endeavor [mOkShAya] to gain freedom [jarA maraNa] from infirmity and death [tE vidu:] know [tat
brahma] the self-existent, [kr'tsnam

		</text>
		<text>



The word 'brahma' is translated to
'self-existent' here, highlighting the fact that it doesn't need the support of
its environment to exist.
		</text>
		<text> This is explained further in the next chapter.
		</text>
		<text>

By leaving the
misfortune of delusion, we get to know the Lord and worship him for a purpose

The phrase 'freedom from infirmity and
death' refers to the curiosity to realize the Self.
		</text>
		<text> This is about knowing the
true nature of the Self, in a form that's not entangled in the environment.
		</text>
		<text> A
few people endeavor to achieve this realization in My sanctuary.
		</text>
		<text> They shall
discern the Self, the environment and all actions in their entirety.

thoughts in devotion, [tE mAm vidu:] they would know Me [prayANa kAlE] at the time of leaving their body [api] too.

		<text>



Since the phrase 'Those who.
		</text>
		<text>.
		</text>
		<text>.
		</text>
		<text>' is repeated
in this Shloka, it indicates the other set of people, distinct from those described
in the previous Shloka.
		</text>
		<text> They're the ones that desire wealth and those who know
Me along with My effects - effects that are observed to come from materials, as
well as the effect of various forces of nature.
		</text>
		<text> 

Though this statement looks like a fact,
it's actually a mandate - the three types
of people who worship the Lord must know that The Lord is above all worship.
		</text>
		<text>
It means the methods of worship apply to all the three types.
		</text>
		<text> All of them need
to do their routine and prescribed activities.
		</text>
		<text> They do it for the Lord's
purpose in His refuge.
		</text>
		<text> This is inevitable.
		</text>
		<text> 

The Lord states- At the time of leaving
their body, all of them will know Me in-line with their aspiration.
		</text>
		<text> 

The word 'too' says that the people
described in the previous Shloka - who are curious to realize the Self, free
from infirmity and death - will also know me at the time leaving this world.
		</text>
		<text> 

This statement applies to those
who know as well.
		</text>
		<text> These people know The Lord as the purpose of all worship.
		</text>
		<text>
They will also know me at the time of leaving this world, according to their
aspiration.
		</text>
		<text> Their aspiration is to have their Self attain Me.
		</text>
		<text> They attain Me.

		<text>Chapter 8

From Chapter 7, we know Lord Krishna as the
Supreme Lord, who is to be worshipped.
		</text>
		<text> He is the owner of all things, conscious
and non-conscious.
		</text>
		<text> He is the cause and the basis of existence of everything.
		</text>
		<text> Everything
exists like His body, so He is addressed by all words.
		</text>
		<text> He directs everything
and is 'above and beyond' with unlimited auspicious qualities

The flood of actions we've committed since
beginning-less time confine us to material experiences.
		</text>
		<text> We are constantly under
the influence of the three qualities of sattva, rajas and tamas.
		</text>
		<text> They conceal the Lord
from us.
		</text>
		<text>

Then, due to great virtuous deeds, a few
people surrender to the Lord.
		</text>
		<text> They push these influences away.
		</text>
		<text> These
worshippers have varied aspirations - to gain wealth, to realize the true
nature of the Self or to attain the Lord Himself.
		</text>
		<text> Such variety is due to
differences in the knowledge they have attained, which is due to differences in
their deeds.
		</text>
		<text>

Among them, the person who aspires to
attain the Lord is always with Him and worships Him alone.
		</text>
		<text> Such a person is
extremely dear to the Lord.
		</text>
		<text> This person is among the best of beings and is very
rare, as stated by the Lord previously.
		</text>
		<text> 

In that context, the Lord went on to
explain the differences among the three
types of worshippers, in what they must know and practice.
		</text>
		<text> In this Chapter,
the Lord elaborates the variety that needs to be distinguished, along with the
variety in practice.

How do we get to
know the Lord?

In the previous chapter (Chap.7#29), it was
mentioned that there are people who take the Lord's refuge to discover the Self
and get free from infirmity and death.
		</text>
		<text> It was mentioned that they must know the
self-existent, the environment and all activity.
		</text>
		<text> Here, Arjuna asks- What are
they?

It was also said that those who desire
wealth must know this material creation, the divine agent operating inside and the
purpose of worship.
		</text>
		<text> What are these? 

Who is the object of worship, for whose
purpose we are in this body, to be known by all three types of worshippers? How does He
stand as the object of all worship? 

In what way do the three types of
worshippers know You (The Lord) when they leave their bodies?

[shrI bhagavAn uvAcha] The Lord said- [brahma] The 'self-existent' denotes [paramam] the one who is beyond everything, [akSharam] who is unchanging.
		</text>
		<text> [adhyAtmam] The phrase 'environment' [uchyatE] refers to [svabhAva:] the nature of this material world.
		</text>
		<text> [visarga:] The act of creating, [bhUta
bhAvOdbhavakara:] which makes all beings and their
experiences [karma sanjnita:]
is meant by the word 'activity'.
		</text>
		<text>



The 'self-existent' is the one who is
beyond this universe, the one who is unchanging, without destruction.
		</text>
		<text> It is the
state of complete awareness.
		</text>
		<text> 

[subAla], 2
says- The subtle rests in enlightenment.
		</text>
		<text> Enlightenment rests in what cannot be
seen.
		</text>
		<text>

Start by knowing the
body of the Lord - The Self, the environment and its activities

The state of 'being beyond the universe'
and 'remaining ever-unchanged' constitute the state of the Self when it is
dis-entangled from the material environment.
		</text>
		<text>

The 'environment' refers to the nature of
this material world.
		</text>
		<text> This is the environment surrounding us - matter that is
distinct from the Self, yet relates to the Self - consisting of all gross and
subtle things and their influences.
		</text>
		<text> The fact that these are to be known is also
mentioned in the [panchAgni vidyA].
		</text>
		<text> 

A person desiring Moksha
must know the environment as a set of things that can be acquired and given up.
		</text>
		<text>

The word 'activity' refers to the act of
creating, which makes all beings and their experiences happen - such as the
experiences that happen in a human body.
		</text>
		<text> A person who desires Moksha
must know the act of creation that materialized these experiences.
		</text>
		<text> He must know
other actions as well - which bring so much anxiety - and break free of their
influence.
		</text>
		<text> 

Later in this chapter, the Lord says this
about the pure experience of the Self: 'Yearning for which, people practice
celibacy and study ' (Chap.8#11)

[dEhabhr'tAm vara] O best among the beings who have a body, [adhibhUtam] the entire material creation [kSharO
bhAva:] has the effect of eventually wearing out.
		</text>
		<text> [adhidaivatam cha] Further, the 'divine agent'
[puruSha:] is the person who is
above all forces of the universe.
		</text>
		<text> [adhiyajnO] The purpose of worship [ahamEva] is none other than Me, [atra dEhE] situated inside the body.
		</text>
		<text>



The entire material creation, which is to
be known by people who yearn for wealth, is experienced to wear out.
		</text>
		<text> It is in
the nature of material things - everything eventually wears out.
		</text>
		<text> This effect
resides in stimuli such as sound and touch as well.
		</text>
		<text> The various sounds, touch,
beauty, taste and smells are sought by people who yearn for wealth.
		</text>
		<text> Such people
yearn for these stimuli, along with the things that stimulate.
		</text>
		<text> 

The 'divine agent' is the supreme person -
the one who is above all powers, the one who is the real enjoyer of all
experiences.
		</text>
		<text> People who yearn for wealth must be in the quest of this state of
enjoyment.
		</text>
		<text>

The purpose of all work and worship is Me.
		</text>
		<text>
I am the one who is gratified by worship.
		</text>
		<text> I am situated as the basis of everyone's
Self and they are like My body.
		</text>
		<text> In this
way, I am the one who is served when people gratify anyone by worship.
		</text>
		<text> The three types of worshippers must keep
this in mind, while performing various forms of worship.

Those who think of the
Lord while leaving their body will attain the Lord

This too, applies to each of the three types of worshippers.
		</text>
		<text>
At the end of a life-time, the person who gives up his body and passes away
while thinking exclusively of Me, will attain My status.
		</text>
		<text> Here, the phrase 'My
status' refers to the nature of the Lord.
		</text>
		<text> At the end of a life-time, a person
achieves the form that he focuses on.
		</text>
		<text> For instance, as illustrated in the
scriptures, a person who thought about a deer at the time of death is born in
the body of a deer.
		</text>
		<text>

The next Shloka describes this very fact
unambiguously - the nature of the final thought is such that the thinker is
re-born in the same form as the thought.

thinking about it all the time.
		</text>
		<text>



With practice and focus every day, a person
thinks about Me without allowing the consciousness to wander anywhere else.
		</text>
		<text>
This person will think about Me at the end of his life and attain Me, as
described in the next Shlokas.
		</text>
		<text> 

If you yearn for
wealth, think of the Lord as the owner of all wealth

This person becomes equivalent to the Lord
- by being associated with ultimate wealth that is equivalent to the Lord's - just
as in the example where a person thinks about a deer at the end of his life and
gets that form.
		</text>
		<text>

Let's now examine the words 'practice' and
'focus' in this Shloka.
		</text>
		<text> 

'Practice' is the worship of the Lord in
our minds at all times permitted by daily routine.
		</text>
		<text> It's about making a habit of
worshipping the Lord.
		</text>
		<text> 'Focus' is the worship of the Lord every day at a
dedicated time, in a manner that has been described before.

The Lord knows everything, is ancient,

entire universe.
		</text>
		<text> The Lord is even more subtle than the Self (which itself isn't
perceptible).
		</text>
		<text> 

He is the creator of everything.
		</text>
		<text> The Lord
has a form that cannot be realized in our thoughts, since no other entity has a
form that is similar to the Lord's.
		</text>
		<text> He has the color of the Sun and is beyond
darkness - The Lord is distinct from the environment that we perceive; He has a
lustrous form, which is completely unusual.
		</text>
		<text> 

With focus and devotion, this person
practices everyday with an unmoving mind.
		</text>
		<text> Perfecting this practice by regular
habit, he holds his life-breath between his eye-brows.
		</text>
		<text> Meaning, he converges
his thoughts to focus the divine Lord in the region between his eye-brows.
		</text>
		<text> 

Such a person shall come towards the Lord -
he converges to the same state of being and be equal in wealth to the Lord.

Next, the Lord describes how He is
remembered by those who yearn to experience the Self.

denotes the Lord, [mAm anusmaran] keeping Me in his thoughts [dEha tyajan] while giving up his body: [ya:] The one who [prayAti] leaves in this way [sa: yAti] attains [paramAm gatim] the ultimate goal.
		</text>
		<text>



A person who leaves his body while focusing
all thoughts on Me would hold his life-breath at the summit and attain the
supreme goal, chanting the single syllable 'Om' addressing Me.
		</text>
		<text>

This person restrains all sense organs from
indulging.
		</text>
		<text> Sense organs such as ears and eyes are his doors of knowledge.
		</text>
		<text> He
stations the mind to focus on Me, the indestructible one situated at his heart.
		</text>
		<text>
He maintains the state of yoga - a state
where he positions himself immovably in Me alone.
		</text>
		<text> 

Such a person obtains the Self in a form
that's equal to Me, devoid of all limitations of the environment.
		</text>
		<text> He does not
return from this ever again.
		</text>
		<text> 

This is also
mentioned later in this chapter.
		</text>
		<text> Chap.8#20 says 'The one
who doesn't perish when all beings perish' and Chap.8#21:
'The subtle one doesn't wear out.
		</text>
		<text> He is called the ultimate destination'.
		</text>
		<text>

Up until now, the Lord described methods to
worship Him - practiced by people who yearn for wealth and those who yearn for
an experience of the Self.
		</text>
		<text> Each of them worships in a way that is in-line with
their aspirations.
		</text>
		<text> 

Next, the Lord describes a method of
worship, which is practiced by the one who knows.
		</text>
		<text> The Lord
also describes the way in which such a person attains the Lord.

[pArtha] Arjuna,
[aham sulabha:]  I am easily available
[tasya] to a person [yO mAm smarati] who thinks about Me [satatam] at all times, [nityasha:] right from the time he starts
his journey to achieve Me.
		</text>
		<text> [yOgina:] He is My devoted follower, [ananya chEtA:] and doesn't let his mind wander among other subjects.
		</text>
		<text> [nitya yuktasya] He is always attached to
Me.
		</text>
		<text>



If you yearn for the
Lord Himself, just adore him!

The Lord begins by saying - 

I am easily available to the person who
remembers Me at all times, without getting drawn towards other things, right
from the time he starts his endeavor to attain Me.
		</text>
		<text> Due to limitless affection
towards Me, this person cannot exist in his body without having My thought.
		</text>
		<text>

In this way, he thinks about Me with
unbounded affection.
		</text>
		<text> I am easily available to such a devoted person, who yearns
for ever-lasting attachment towards Me.
		</text>
		<text> This person is going to attain Me - not
just equivalence in terms of wealth, joy or other attributes.
		</text>
		<text>

I will gratify him Myself, unable to
tolerate any separation from him.
		</text>
		<text> I Myself will give him the quality of having
excessive affection towards Me.
		</text>
		<text> I will grant him the ultimate form of My
service, as appropriate to achieve Me.
		</text>
		<text> I will remove all obstacles that come in
the way of rendering service to Me.
		</text>
		<text> 

As said in the scriptures, in [muMDaka], 3-2-3: The Lord is achievable only to the people who are favored by the
Lord.
		</text>
		<text>

It is also said in Chap.10#10 and Chap.10#11:
To those who worship me with affection and are always attached to Me, I will
give that intellect - [buddhiyOga] - using
which they achieve Me.
		</text>
		<text> By My compassion towards them, I will station Myself in
their minds.
		</text>
		<text> Shining as the lamp of knowledge, I shall destroy darkness that is
generated by the ignorance in them.
		</text>
		<text>

In the remaining part of this chapter after
the next Shloka, the Lord explains that the people who know
and those who yearn for an experience of the Self do not return to the
limitations of this world.
		</text>
		<text> Those who yearn for wealth do return.
		</text>
		<text>

Just as a reminder: Those who yearn for
wealth, those who yearn for an experience of the Self and those who know are the three types of people who
worship the Lord.

[mAm upEtya]
Having attained Me, [nApnuvanti] they do not get [ashAshvatam] a temporary [punarjanma] birth again, [du:khAlayam] which is an abode of suffering.
		</text>
		<text> [mahAtmAna:] These great people [gatA:] have reached [paramAm] the ultimate [samsiddhim] state of complete attainment.

These people know My true nature and have
excessive affection towards Me.
		</text>
		<text> They attain Me with their affection and shall never
get a transient birth full of sorrows again.
		</text>
		<text> 

With the intention to attain Me, knowing
they cannot even exist without Me, these great people take refuge in Me and
worship Me.
		</text>
		<text> They achieve Me, the ultimate goal.
		</text>
		<text> 

Next, the Lord explains why people who
yearn and achieve wealth will return to be born, while people who achieve the
Lord don't return.

[arjuna]
Arjuna, [lOkA:] all worlds [punarAvartina:] get destroyed and return
again.
		</text>
		<text> [Abrahma bhuvanAt] That
includes the world of Brahma, the engineer of the universe.
		</text>
		<text> [tu] However, [kauntEya] Arjuna, [mAm upEtya] having approached Me, [na vidyatE] there is no [punarjanma] re-birth.
		</text>
		<text>



The material universe
keeps going in cycles.
		</text>
		<text> So does a person who yearns for material wealth

Everywhere in the universe, wealth and
enjoyment are pursued - right from the world of Brahma, the engineer of this
universe.
		</text>
		<text> All these worlds return again - after being destroyed periodically.
		</text>
		<text>

Thus, people who did achieve the wealth
they desired will inevitably be destroyed - by the destruction of the position
they attained.
		</text>
		<text>

This destruction does not happen to those
who have attained Me - I have enormous compassion, My will is always realized,
I know everything and My form always remains unchanged.
		</text>
		<text> The act of creation,
existence and destruction of the entire universe is My game.
		</text>
		<text> 

People who have Me as their abode do not go
through cycles of destruction and return to this world.
		</text>
		<text>

Next, the Lord describes the time-lines of
creation and destruction of the various worlds and their inhabitants, including
that of Brahma, as brought-about by the will of the Lord.

[tE janA:] The people [ahOrAtra vidO] who have learnt the measures of day and night [vidu:] know [yat
brahmaNO aha:] that a day of Brahma (the primary
engineer of the universe) [yat sahasra yuga paryantam] is equal to a thousand four-yuga periods.
		</text>
		<text> [rAtrim] Similarly, his night [yuga sahasrAntam] lasts a thousand four-yuga periods too.
		</text>
		<text>

[aharAgamE] When this day arrives, [sarvA: vyaktaya:] all of creation [prabhavanti] comes into being [avyaktAt] from the state of being imperceptible.
		</text>
		<text> [rAtryAgamE] When the night of Brahma arrives, [pralIyantE] they dissolve [tatraiva] into the same [avyaktasanjnakE] state of being
imperceptible.
		</text>
		<text>

[pArtha] Arjuna, [sa Eva]
The same [ayam bhUtagrAma:]
world of beings [bhUtvA bhUtvA]
gets created again and again [pralIyatE] and gets dissolved [rAtryAgamE] when the night comes.
		</text>
		<text> [aharAgamE] When the day arrives, [prabhavati] it comes into being, [avasha:] it's unstoppable.
		</text>
		<text>



There is a great variety of beings in this
universe - humans, other creatures, right up to Brahma, the engineer of the
universe.
		</text>
		<text> The arrangement of day and night for various beings is different.
		</text>
		<text>
People who are aware of this would know that one day of Brahma lasts a thousand
four-yuga periods.
		</text>
		<text> The duration of the night is similar to
the day.
		</text>
		<text> It is so by My intent.
		</text>
		<text> 

When such a day of Brahma arrives,
everything in this world - the environment, bodies and organs, things that are
to be experienced, the different individuals that experience them - come into
being from an imperceptible state, which is situated in the body of Brahma.
		</text>
		<text>

In this imperceptible state, they cannot
be distinguished as individuals.
		</text>
		<text> The word [avyakta] means 'imperceptible', 'a state of being indistinct'.
		</text>
		<text>

When the following night arrives, they
dissolve into the same indistinct state inside the body of Brahma - they cease
to be perceptible individuals.
		</text>
		<text> 

The very same ecosystem of individuals comes
into being repeatedly when the day arrives - an inevitable consequence of the
deeds they committed in the past.
		</text>
		<text> They dissolve and become imperceptible at
nightfall.
		</text>
		<text> They become perceptible again when the day arrives.
		</text>
		<text> 

After the passage of 100 years consisting
of such days and nights, which to humans means the passage of several thousand yuga, all worlds dissolve into Me, including the world of the
principal engineer Brahma, including all individuals, including Brahma himself
- as said in [subAla.2]: 'Solids dissolve in liquids, the liquids dissolve into energy'

Thus, the world dissolves into an
imperceptible state, all the way till the indestructible and the invisible.
		</text>
		<text> It
finally dissolves into Me alone.
		</text>
		<text>

In this way, everything other than Me is
inevitably born and destroyed in a time-bound manner.
		</text>
		<text> It implies that those who
yearn for wealth inevitably return again and again.
		</text>
		<text> On the other hand, those
who have approached and achieved Me aren't forced into this cycle of inevitable
return.
		</text>
		<text>

Next, the Lord says that people who worship
Him while yearning to experience the Self are freed from return too.

[para:] The one

the ultimate destination.

		<text> [yam prApya tat] Having obtained that [dhAma paramam mama] ultimate abode of mine, [na nivartantE] they do not return.
		</text>
		<text>



As in Chap.8#11, this Shloka describes
the nature of the Lord as manifested in the Self, in terms of being
imperceptible and ever-lasting.
		</text>
		<text>

There is a goal to achieve, beyond this
universe made from primordial matter.
		</text>
		<text> It is entirely distinct from any matter,
since it exists in the form of knowledge alone.
		</text>
		<text> It is not apparent to us and
cannot be described in terms of anything else.
		</text>
		<text> It is unique in its form.
		</text>
		<text> 

The Self is
ever-lasting, so the one who yearns for the Self isn't stuck in creation and
destruction

It is ancient and not subject to creation
and destruction - it lasts forever.
		</text>
		<text> Even while being inside everything in
space, in everything that goes into creation, in everything that's created, even
when all of this is destroyed, it doesn't perish.
		</text>
		<text> It is called imperceptible
and imperishable in several Shlokas:

Chap.12#3: 'those who focus on the
indestructible, which cannot be distinguished, which isn't evident to our
senses'

Chap.15#16: 'Staying like an anvil without
deforming, it is said to be imperishable'.
		</text>
		<text>

Experienced people say that it is the
ultimate goal, as said in Chap.8#13: 'the one who leaves his body attains the
ultimate goal'

Thus, the one that's termed 'the ultimate
destination' over here is the one that's not destroyed.
		</text>
		<text> Meaning, this goal is
the Self that's free from the influences of nature.
		</text>
		<text> People who realize the Self
in this state do not return.
		</text>
		<text> The Lord says - this is My 'ultimate abode', the
ultimate seat from which the Lord rules over this universe.
		</text>
		<text> 

The non-conscious material environment is
one seat from which the Lord rules.
		</text>
		<text> The Self in a state of attachment to the
environment is the second seat.
		</text>
		<text> 

Beyond this, the pure and free Self is the
ultimate Seat of the Lord, from where He rules the universe - that is the seat
meant by the phrase 'ultimate abode' here.
		</text>
		<text> It is detached from the environment.
		</text>
		<text>
This abode does not go through cycles of creation and destruction.
		</text>
		<text> 

The word 'abode' also denotes a state of
lustrous existence.
		</text>
		<text> Here, luster is knowledge.
		</text>
		<text> When the Self is entangled in
the environment, its knowledge is confined.
		</text>
		<text> When the Self is freed from the
confines of the environment, it is an unbroken expanse of knowledge.
		</text>
		<text> This is
the superior state of existence.
		</text>
		<text>

In the next Shloka, the Lord says that those who know will aim to attain something that's totally
distinct from what has just been described.

[pArtha]
Arjuna, [yasya anta:] the
person in whom [sthAni bhUtAni]
all beings exist, [yEna sarvam idam] by whom all this [tatam] is pervaded, [sa para: puruSha:] that ultimate person [labhya:] is obtained by [ananyA bhaktyA] undistracted devotion, not being attached to anything else.
		</text>
		<text>



The Lord has already described Himself in
the following Shlokas:

Chap.7#7: 'There is absolutely nothing else
that is beyond Me.
		</text>
		<text> All of this is mounted in Me, just as beads are strung in a
string'

Chap.7#13: 'I am beyond the three qualities and every being that's
under their influence.
		</text>
		<text> I stay unchanged'

The person who adores
the Lord gets the Lord Himself.
		</text>
		<text> He goes beyond all cycles

All beings exist inside the Lord.
		</text>
		<text> He is the
ultimate being who pervades everything.
		</text>
		<text> 

He can be obtained through devotion,
practiced without attachment towards anything else - as said in Chap.8#14: 'I
am easily available to a person who thinks about Me at all times, right from
the time he starts his journey to achieve Me.
		</text>
		<text> He is My devoted follower.
		</text>
		<text> He doesn't
let his mind wander among other subjects.
		</text>
		<text> He is always attached to Me.
		</text>
		<text>'

The previous Shloka described the person
who yearns to know the true nature of the Self - this person realizes the true
nature of the Self and the Lord presiding over it.
		</text>
		<text> In this Shloka, The Lord
described a person who yearns for the Lord Himself.
		</text>
		<text> Next, the Lord describes
the path taken by both of them when they depart from the body.
		</text>
		<text>

Both types of people go on the 'path of luster'.
		</text>
		<text>
This path doesn't put them on the inevitable cycle of return.
		</text>
		<text>

There are two possible paths when we
depart from our body.
		</text>
		<text> One path leads to rebirth, while the other leads to
freedom from birth and death.
		</text>
		<text> The one that leads to rebirth is called [dhUmAdi mArga], literally 'the path of
smoke'.
		</text>
		<text> The other one called [archirAdi mArga], literally 'the path of luster', is the one that leads to Moksha - freedom from this cycle.
		</text>
		<text>

The scriptures describe their path:

The [panchAgni vidyA] in [ChAndOgya], 5-10-1 says: 'Those who know the true nature of the Self in this way, as
well as those who worship the Lord by dedicating their thoughts to Him will
take the path of luster and meet the dawn of freedom'.
		</text>
		<text> It describes the path that
leads to the Lord Himself.
		</text>
		<text> 

It also says that the path doesn't force
you to return.
		</text>
		<text> [ChAndOgya], 4-25-6 describes the end-point of this path: 'The guide leads them to the
Lord.
		</text>
		<text> Once they proceed, they do not return to the cycles of this human world'.
		</text>
		<text>

The knowledge described above in the [panchAgni vidyA] is not about knowing the Self.
		</text>
		<text> Such knowledge is described
elsewhere in the scriptures - that is about knowing who you are and doesn't
lead to liberation.
		</text>
		<text> Those who know the Self as an
attribute of the Lord are the ones who attain liberation.
		</text>
		<text>

Further in the [panchAgni vidyA], in [ChAndOgya], 5-9-1, it says that the Self gets associated
with the elements of nature.
		</text>
		<text> In [ChAndOgya], 5-10-7, it says that virtue leads
to a fortunate configuration of the elements, like a human body.
		</text>
		<text> Vice leads to
unfortunate configurations such as a dog or a pig.
		</text>
		<text> In this way, the scriptures
describe the temporary entanglement between the Self and a body and the
distinction between them.
		</text>
		<text> [ChAndOgya], 5-10-7 continues to say that those
who know this will take the path of luster and will not return to the
birth-and-death cycle.
		</text>
		<text>

In this way, The Lord showed the
distinction between the Self and the environment.
		</text>
		<text> We need to rise above the
environment and gain consciousness that's separate from the environment.
		</text>
		<text> In
this way we take the path of luster and don't need to return.
		</text>
		<text>

Having realized the true nature of the Self,
a person knows that it has the Lord as its Self.
		</text>
		<text> The Self exists only for the
Lord's purpose.
		</text>
		<text> This is told in the [br'hadArAnyaka].
		</text>
		<text> With this awareness,
he gains a form that is equal to attaining the Lord Himself - just like a
person who intends to attain the Lord directly.

This Shloka uses phrases such as brightness,
the day, the bright half of the lunar cycle, the six months when the Sun shifts
northwards.

		<text> These phrases illustrate the space and time of the path of luster.

		<text> The path of darkness is the one described with smoke.
		</text>
		<text> The path of luster leads
to freedom from return.
		</text>
		<text> The path of darkness eventually results in return.

		<text> 

The scriptures say that these two paths are
eternal.
		</text>
		<text> Across cycles of creation and destruction, the paths of light and
darkness are travelled by devotees and various people of virtue.
		</text>
		<text> 

As quoted before in [ChAndOgya], 5-10-1: 'Those who know the true nature of the Self in this way, as well
as those who worship the Lord by dedicating their thoughts to Him will take the
path of luster and meet the dawn of freedom'.
		</text>
		<text> Following that, in [ChAndOgya], 5-10-3: 'Those who serve by sacrifice, by doing virtuous work such as
building canals to benefit others, by donating things and so on - they would
get the path with smoke'

In this world, we experience joy by gaining
something, by studying, contemplation, ceremonies, charity and so on.

gained by meditation and the study of the Vedas are as insignificant as a blade

In the previous chapter, The Lord described
the four types of worshippers and their
distinctions.

This chapter explores the greatness of the
Lord- He is the objective of any worship.

		<text> It also explores the specialty of the
devotee - the one who knows.

describes the characteristics of worship, which is called devotion.

This awareness is the foremost among all
learnings - it is supreme among all that can be learnt.
		</text>
		<text> It is the foremost
among everything that's tough to find.
		</text>
		<text> It is concealed the most, beyond
everything that's concealed from us.
		</text>
		<text> 

The phrase [rAjavidyA] in this Shloka could also be interpreted as 'a learning fit for
kings'.
		</text>
		<text> The word 'king' refers to someone with great depth and a vast, open
mind.
		</text>
		<text> Such people are good at learning, discovering and preserving.
		</text>
		<text> What's
learnt stays with such people.
		</text>
		<text>

This awareness is supreme and pure.
		</text>
		<text> It
takes away all faults that come in the way of attaining Me, not leaving any flaw
behind.
		</text>
		<text> It's there for us to experience - to comprehend using our sense organs
and our thoughts.
		</text>
		<text> Written as the Lord's words: 'When I am worshipped with
service in the form of devotion, I become
perceptible to the person who worships Me'.
		</text>
		<text>

It also has virtue embedded in it -
'Virtue' is practiced to achieve glory.
		</text>
		<text> Achieving Me is the highest glory.
		</text>
		<text> By
its very nature, this devotion is an excess of
love that's impossible to describe in words.
		</text>
		<text>

You perceive Me with devotion.
		</text>
		<text> Though perceiving
Me is excellent by itself, it's really a means to experience Me completely.
		</text>
		<text> You
achieve Me in My unsurpassed form.
		</text>
		<text>

You could choose to practice it very
easily, because it has an un-measurable amount of love in it.
		</text>
		<text> 

It never wears out - even after achieving
Me, it does not get spent.
		</text>
		<text> Even after presenting Myself to the person who
worships Me in this way, I keep feeling that there's something I still owe this
person.

It's indeed incredible that people still
don't believe in its practice! That is the opinion expressed here.

[idam sarvam jagat] This whole world [tatam] is pervaded [mayA]
by Me, [avyakta mUrtinA] with My
imperceptible form.
		</text>
		<text> [sarva bhUtAni] All beings [matsthAni] are situated in Me [cha] and [aham] I [na avasthita:] do not have any dependency [tEShu] on them.
		</text>
		<text>

[cha] Moreover,
[matsthAni na] I am not bound
to carry [bhUtAni] all beings.
		</text>
		<text> [pashya] Look at [mE] My [yOgam] status [aishvaram] as being the owner of the
universe.
		</text>
		<text> [bhUtabhr't] I
support these beings [na cha bhUtastha:] without being bound in them.
		</text>
		<text> [mama AtmA] My intent [bhUta bhAvana:] causes all of them to be.
		</text>
		<text>



The will of the Lord
causes all beings to 'be'

This entire world, along with its conscious
and non-conscious entities, is pervaded by Me.
		</text>
		<text> I pervade by being embedded in
everything - in a form that's invisible and not accessible by any sense organ.
		</text>
		<text> I
pervade this world to control and carry it forward.
		</text>
		<text>

This pervasive nature of the Lord embedded
in everything is also described in:

[br'hadArAnyaka], 3-7-3: 'The one who is on the Earth.
		</text>
		<text>.
		</text>
		<text>.
		</text>
		<text> whom the Earth does not know'

[br'hadArAnyaka], 3-7-22: 'The one who is inside the Self.
		</text>
		<text>.
		</text>
		<text>.
		</text>
		<text> whom the Self does not know'.
		</text>
		<text>
Thus, the way in which all beings are pervaded has been described - conscious
and non-conscious beings have the Lord embedded in them, while they don't see
it.
		</text>
		<text> 

Then the Lord says it the other way around-
'All beings are in Me'.
		</text>
		<text> 

In other words: 'All beings are in Me,
while I am embedded in them'.
		</text>
		<text> 

Further, the [br'hadArAnyaka] describes the dependence of everything on the Lord.
		</text>
		<text> Every entity is
controlled by Him, as though it were His body:
'The One whose body is the Earth, The One who controls the Earth while being
inside it' and 'The One whose body is the Self, The One who controls the Self
from the inside'.
		</text>
		<text>

Then the Lord says: 'I am not contained in
them'.
		</text>
		<text> With this, He states- 'I am not in a state of dependence on these
beings.
		</text>
		<text> I need no returns from them'.
		</text>
		<text>

The Lord continues: 'I am not bound to
carry all beings' - when I say that I carry all beings, it isn't similar to a pot
that carries water for some purpose.
		</text>
		<text> Then how does all this exist? The universe
exists by My will.
		</text>
		<text>

The Lord elaborates in this Shloka: 'Look
at My status as being the owner of the universe'.
		</text>
		<text> Look at this astonishing state
of being.
		</text>
		<text> It is unique to Me and doesn't exist anywhere else.
		</text>
		<text> What is this
state of being? 

The Lord clarifies in this Shloka - 'I
support these beings without being bound in them.
		</text>
		<text> My intent causes all of them
to be' - I carry them and sustain them, while having no relationship of
usefulness with them.
		</text>
		<text> I create, control and sustain purely by My intent - My
intent is Mine alone, it does not depend on anything else.
		</text>
		<text>

Next, the Lord shows an example to
illustrate that everything exists by his will.

Know [iti] that [yathA] the way in which [sarvANi bhUtAni] all beings [matsthAni] are situated in Me [taThA] is similar.
		</text>
		<text>



The great winds exist in space.
		</text>
		<text> Space
doesn't need anything to exist.
		</text>
		<text> It blows independently everywhere.
		</text>
		<text> Yet, know
that its existence depends on Me.
		</text>
		<text> 

I am the one who carries the wind and all
beings.
		</text>
		<text> They do not experience this.
		</text>
		<text> All beings are situated in Me and I carry
them.
		</text>
		<text>

The Vedas describe The Lord's power: 'The
formation of clouds, the way in which the sea is limited to the sea-level, the
phases of the moon, the agitation of the wind, the way in which lightning strikes,
the movement of the Sun - all these exist as manifestations of Vishnu's
wonderful power'.
		</text>
		<text> This amazing power is unique to Vishnu, not present in
anything else.
		</text>
		<text> 

The scriptures describe it too:

[br'hadArAnyaka], 3-8-9 says: 'The sun, moon and others are carried forth by the Lord, who
is called indestructible.
		</text>
		<text> They remain under His total control'

[taittariya], 2-8-1 says: 'The wind blows in submission to His will.
		</text>
		<text> The Sun glows in
submission to His will.
		</text>
		<text> The atmosphere, sky, rain and fire perform their
functions in submission to His will'.
		</text>
		<text>

Till now, it was stated that the state of
existence of everything is brought about by the will of the Lord.
		</text>
		<text> The will of
the Lord does not depend on anything other than the Lord Himself.
		</text>
		<text> Next, He says
that their creation and destruction too are also brought about by His will
alone.

As [manu], 1-5 says:
'All this was in a state of inactivity.

Also read in [subAla], 7: 'For whom

I create the various beings repeatedly over

This material nature has varied forms and manifests in eight ways (see
Chap.7#4).
		</text>
		<text> It is rich in the three qualities
and is very attractive.
		</text>
		<text> All types of beings are under the influence of this

		<text> Hence, they are deprived of freedom.
		</text>

Now, you may doubt: If The Lord is so
inconsiderate as to perform His act of creation in this way, doesn't this
merciless behavior tarnish Him in any way? The next Shloka resolves this question.

The Lord doesn't

The Lord continues- Yet, these actions such
as the creation of the universe and its beings don't bind Me.
		</text>
		<text> They do not
reward Me with anything.
		</text>
		<text> They do not result in accusations of being merciless.
		</text>
		<text>
That's because the past deeds of conscious beings are reason for the
inequalities among them.
		</text>
		<text> In this creation of variety, I stay without
attachment, as though I am neutral.
		</text>
		<text>

As said in [vEdAnta sUtra], 2-1-34: 'In the disparity of creation, there is no mercilessness on the
part of the Lord.
		</text>
		<text> The disparity arises due to the past deeds of the various

everything that moves and everything that doesn't.

In fact, My supervision is the reason for

		<text> See My ownership, the
realization of My every intent without flaws such as mercilessness, see me as
the son of Vasudeva, see My wealth and My state of being.

[shritA:] They

Without knowing this
reality, people go behind imaginary goals

The material world conceals the supreme
qualities of the Lord in His human form.

		<text> His qualities, such as the abundance
of compassion, aren't apparent.

		<text>

This world advocates the enjoyment of
everything that's attractive and devours anyone who remains in it.

		<text> People go
behind useless desires - their wants lead them nowhere.
		</text>
		<text> They indulge in useless
activities - they start work that is fruitless.

They have knowledge that's useless.
		</text>
		<text> They
observe moving and stationary objects that belong to Me.
		</text>
		<text> Due to the adverse
nature of their knowledge, the understanding they gain is contrary to reality.

		<text>
Such knowledge does not yield anything.

Without the ability to recognize reality,
they are unable to learn the true nature of anything.

Lord of the universe, to be equivalent to others.

whatever they set out to do in regard to Me will fail to yield anything.

Worship and take refuge

People take refuge in Me.

virtuous deeds, they get rid of all undesirable influences that come in the way
of my refuge.

		<text> They reside in the divine environment, knowing it to be one of My

Krishna Himself existed with everything conscious and non-conscious in subtle

this way, [kAma kAmA:] people
who crave for desirable things [anuprapannA:] and advocate [trayI dharmam] the three Vedas to gain these ends [labhantE] keep [gatAgatam]
going and coming back.
		</text>
		<text>



The three Vedas refer to the knowledge
contained in the form of the Rig, Yajur and Sama Vedas.
		</text>
		<text> People who are focused
only on the three Vedas are different from the ones who focus on the Vedantas (also
known as Upanishads), which are at the end of the Vedas.
		</text>
		<text> 

Only people who focus on the Upanishads are
truly great persons.
		</text>
		<text> They worship Me alone, in the manner described
before.
		</text>
		<text> Ultimately, I am the one who is to be known from all the Vedas.
		</text>
		<text>
Knowing Me in this way, they recollect me repeatedly.
		</text>
		<text> Such recollection is
inspired by excessive devotion towards Me.
		</text>
		<text> They worship Me and dedicate
themselves to My study.
		</text>
		<text> They desire to achieve Me alone.
		</text>
		<text>

On the other hand, people who focus only on
the three Vedas get free from misfortunes that prevent them achieving a world
of comfort.
		</text>
		<text> Their method is to follow the rituals prescribed in the Vedas.
		</text>
		<text>
Those rituals concern the forces of the environment.
		</text>
		<text> They consume the left-overs
from those rituals.
		</text>
		<text> 

Actually, with these rituals, they are
appeasing forces that are a manifestation of My form.
		</text>
		<text> However, they don't know
it, so they end up craving for material comforts.
		</text>
		<text> They enter worlds that are
auspicious - meaning they are not mingled in sorrow.
		</text>
		<text> They experience a vast
amount of comfort.
		</text>
		<text> When the effect of their virtuous deeds wanes, they end up
in the human world again, with all its attendant sorrows.
		</text>
		<text>

In this way, they miss the knowledge in the
Vedantas - they do not know Me and end up craving for various comforts and
desires.
		</text>
		<text> They merely follow the three Vedas and end up returning repeatedly -
they only experience comforts that are small and temporary and return to the
normal world again.
		</text>
		<text> 

On the other hand, those who are gifted think
of Me with unbounded affection.
		</text>
		<text> They attain Me, the supreme and ever-lasting
joy.
		</text>
		<text> They do not return.

Followers of the three Vedas worship
various sources of power with great faith.

		<text> In reality, they worship Me too.
		</text>
		<text>
That's because everything exists as My
body.
		</text>
		<text> The names of all gods and various
powers actually address Me.
		</text>
		<text> 

However, these followers worship without
following the prescribed procedure completely.
		</text>
		<text> They do not worship according to
the Vedantas, which have laid out the fact that everything in the universe
exists as the Lord's body.
		</text>
		<text> 

Service to any source of power, when
rendered with the thought that it exists as the body of the Lord, is worship
according to the prescribed procedure.
		</text>
		<text> 

On the other hand, service to anyone, rendered
while seeing them as the recipient of the service isn't according to the
prescribed procedure.
		</text>
		<text> People who render service in this way practice Vedic philosophy
that's related to material comforts.
		</text>
		<text> They don't know that the Lord is the One
who is worshipped by all forms of service; that He alone is to be worshipped.
		</text>
		<text> 

Such people attain limited results.
		</text>
		<text> After
their achievement is done, it's in their nature to fall back and lose the
achievement.

With the phrase 'Single Master', the Lord
state that He Himself appears as the benefactor wherever benefits are

Indeed, this strange distinction is
astounding - Some people get stuck with minor results and keep falling from
their place.

		<text> Others end up enjoying uninterrupted, unlimited joy, in the form
of eternal union with the Lord.

achieve Me and never fall back.

		<text> I am without birth or destruction.

everything and My intent is always fulfilled.
		</text>
		<text> I am a great ocean of unlimited
variety of great qualities, an abode of unbroken and infinite joy'.

Next, the Lord describes yet another aspect
that's special in His devotees:

[yO] Anyone who
[prayachChati] offers [patram] a leaf, [puShpam] a flower, [phalam],
a fruit [tOyam] or water [mE] to Me [bhaktyA] with devotion - [aham] I [ashnAmi] will
accept [tat] whatever [bhaktyupahr'tam] is offered with devotion [prayatAtmana:] by a person who is so dedicated to Me.
		</text>
		<text>



A devotee offers Me something with devotion.
		</text>
		<text> It could be anything that's easily
available - like a leaf, a flower, a fruit or water.
		</text>
		<text> Such a devotee has
limitless affection towards Me and can't sustain himself without offering
things to Me.
		</text>
		<text> To this person, making the offering itself is the reward.
		</text>
		<text>

Even though I am the Lord of everything,
though the lifecycle of the universe is My sport, though all My desires are
always fulfilled and My intent always realized, though I exist with limitless
and unbroken favorable qualities of infinite variety, though My nature is one
of infinite amounts of continuous joy, I accept this offering.
		</text>
		<text>

In fact, I accept it with all eagerness; like
I finally got something I yearned for, which was out of My reach.
		</text>
		<text> That's
because it was made with devotion, dedication and a pure mind, without any intention
other than making the offering to Me.
		</text>
		<text>

As stated in [mOkSha
dharma], 353-64: Being engaged in our work, with our
intellect working towards a single goal (to attain the Supreme Lord), any
actions performed are accepted with great regard by the Lord Himself.
		</text>
		<text>

Gifted people who know Me
are special in a way that's not expressible by thought and speech.
		</text>
		<text> Be a person who knows.
		</text>
		<text> Weigh down your Self and everything that's
yours with the weight of devotion described before.
		</text>
		<text>
Indulge in praise, work, worship and respect without interruption.
		</text>
		<text> While
indulging in them, do your work in this world as follows-

[yat karOShi]
Whatever you do, [yat ashnAsi]
whatever you consume, [yat juhOShi] whatever you sacrifice, [dadAsi yat] whatever you give away, [yat tapasyasi] any thought you concentrate on, [tat
kuruShva] make it [arpaNam] a dedication [mat]
to Me



The
Lord states- 'Dedicate everything to Me.
		</text>
		<text> That includes any remaining activities
you do in this world till you depart from your body.
		</text>
		<text> Your daily routine, your
responsibilities such as charity, focus and sacrifice, everything you consume
to maintain your body- dedicate all of it to Me'.
		</text>
		<text>

'Dedication' is to make an offering to the
Lord.
		</text>
		<text> 

What can we possibly offer
the Lord of the universe?

As The Lord Himself stated- Your activities
and responsibilities bring a feeling of having done something.
		</text>
		<text> They also bring
enjoyment, experience and the sense of having rendered service.
		</text>
		<text> Do them in such
a way that they are offered to Me.
		</text>
		<text>

In other words: You are a doer of your
work.
		</text>
		<text> You have a purpose and experience the outcome.
		</text>
		<text> All of this belongs to Me
and takes form, exists and sustains according to My will.
		</text>
		<text> So, leave all of it
in Me, the ultimate controller and reason for all existence.
		</text>
		<text> 

With abundant affection towards Me, your
ultimate joy is in being under My control alone - stay in this thought always,
knowing that you are being controlled by Me.
		</text>
		<text> Any other person or power has this very same property.
		</text>

free [karma bandhanai:] from the
bondage of activity [shubhAshuba phalai:] with its favorable and unfavorable outcomes.

of letting-go.
		</text>
		<text> [vimukta:] You
will be free and [mAm upaiShyasi] attain Me.
		</text>

In this way, with the intention of
letting-go, your joy is to perform under My will in My service.
		</text>
		<text> Then, all your
activities become My worship.
		</text>
		<text> By arranging yourself in this way and doing your
work, you get freedom from all expectations and outcomes.
		</text>
		<text> 

Ordinarily, these outcomes seem favorable
or unfavorable, going by your bondage to an endless list of past deeds.
		</text>
		<text> That
becomes a barrier to attain Me.
		</text>
		<text> 

When all your activities become My worship,
you get free of all those barriers.
		</text>
		<text> You will attain Me.

Next, listen to My characteristic that goes
beyond all activities of this world-

We see a great variety among humans,
animals and all beings - in terms of their shape, form, status, abilities and their
level of awareness.
		</text>
		<text> We see them ranging from high to being extremely low.

		<text> 

The Lord says - 'I look at all of them as
being equal when they seek refuge in Me.
		</text>
		<text> I do not despise anyone due to their
lowly shape, lack of awareness or inferior status.
		</text>
		<text> I do not reject them because
they have acted against My instructions.
		</text>
		<text> Also, I do not have the attachment of
love towards someone of high status and knowledge - unless they have
surrendered to Me.
		</text>
		<text> They do not gain My acceptance just because they have good
fortune.
		</text>
		<text> Their status doesn't matter to Me.
		</text>
		<text>

On the other hand, those who worship Me
with affection cannot stay without worshipping Me.
		</text>
		<text> They have My worship as
their only goal.

		<text> Their status, capability and knowledge may be high or low -
they are all equal to Me.

sAdhurEva sa mantavya: samyak
vyavasitO hi sa: || 30 ||
		</text>
		<text>

]

[api chEt] Even
when [sudurAchAra:] a very
offensive person [bhajatE mAm]
worships Me [ananyabhAk] with
unwavering devotion, [mantavya:] he needs to be considered as [sAdhu: Eva] virtuous indeed.
		</text>
		<text> [sa: hi] He definitely [samyak vyavasita:] has the appropriate determination.
		</text>
		<text>



Having been born as a certain type of
being, there are certain ways to behave and certain misbehaviors to avoid.
		</text>
		<text> A
person who doesn't comply and crosses the line is considered very offensive.
		</text>
		<text> 

When such a person worships the Lord with
unwavering devotion, with the worship alone being the goal, he needs to be
considered virtuous.
		</text>
		<text> He is a topper among the followers of the Lord, equal to
the kind of people described in the previous Shloka.
		</text>
		<text>

How come? 

In this Shloka, the statement 'he has made
the appropriate resolution' says that his determination is true and proper.
		</text>
		<text>
This person has firmly resolved- 'The Lord is the one and only origin of the
entire universe.
		</text>
		<text> He is the ultimate creator.
		</text>
		<text> He is the goal of all humans.
		</text>
		<text> He
is the master of all things moving and stationary.
		</text>
		<text> He is our controller, my
guide, my friend and He gives ultimate joy'.
		</text>
		<text> Such a resolution is difficult and
rare.
		</text>
		<text> 

With this kind of resolution, a person is
in constant worship of the Lord - with worship itself being the goal of his
worship.
		</text>
		<text> Hence, this person must be considered virtuous indeed and be
respected.
		</text>
		<text> Considering his resolve and consequent worship, the malicious deeds
he commits are to be considered as minor imperfections.
		</text>
		<text> This person is not to
be disrespected for those deeds.
		</text>
		<text> Instead, this person must be praised - this is
the summary here.
		</text>
		<text>

Now, a question arises - Will the misconduct
of this person not restrict the flow of devotion in future? As said in [kaThOpaniShat, 1-2-24]: 'Those who cannot
keep off misconduct, those in whom desire and anger do not subside, even those whose
mind does not have peace - such people cannot achieve Him through knowledge'.
		</text>
		<text>
Will he still be capable of devotion?

This question is answered next -

[kShipram] Very
soon, [bhavati] this person
becomes [dharmAtmA] an
excellent devotee, who worships Me without flaw.
		</text>
		<text> [nigachChati] He attains [shAntim] peaceful existence [shashwat] forever.
		</text>
		<text> [kauntEya]
Arjuna, [pratijAnIhi] resolve
firmly within yourself that [mE bhakta:] My devotee [na praNashyati] shall not waste away.
		</text>
		<text>



Affection towards Me inspires My worship.
		</text>
		<text>
When a person has no other objective, he gets rid of his flaws.
		</text>
		<text> By the same
worship, he uproots the qualities of rajas and
tamas.
		</text>
		<text> In this way he attains excellence
quickly.
		</text>
		<text> Without delay, he is free of obstacles and is fully able to worship Me
alone in his mind.
		</text>
		<text> 

The word 'dharma' used in this Shloka to
mean 'devoted worship' has also been used in the beginning
of this chapter (Chap.9#3) in a similar manner.
		</text>
		<text>

A person who worships attains ever-lasting
peace - he gets rid of behaviors and deeds that prevent him from attaining Me.
		</text>
		<text>
Those deeds and behaviors never return.
		</text>
		<text> 

Arjuna, now resolve to yourself - 'The
Lord's devotee shall not waste away, even if he strays from the path of virtue
and mingles with behaviors that are against My instructions.
		</text>
		<text> Instead, by the
greatness of My devotion, he destroys all types of bondage.
		</text>
		<text> He attains
ever-lasting freedom from them.
		</text>
		<text> He shall attain whole and complete devotion
very soon'.

[pArtha] Arjuna, [yO_pi striyO vaishyA: tathA

[pApayOnaya: syu:] even those
who've tread the path of malice - [tE_pi] they will [parAm gatim yAnti hi] definitely attain the supreme goal [mAm vyapAshritya] after taking refuge in
Me.

[kim puna:] It goes without saying that the same applies [puNyA:] to the virtuous, [bhaktA:] to My devotees, [brAhmaNA:] to those who seek to worship [tathA rAjarShaya:] and administrators who
rule on My behalf.
		</text>
		<text> [bhajasva mAm] Worship Me, [prApya] now that you have obtained [imam lOkam] this world, [anityam] which is temporary [asukham] and is devoid of lasting joy.
		</text>
		<text>



Without exception,
everyone can devote themselves to the Lord

Anyone can attain Me and reach the ultimate
goal - Ladies, Gentlemen, people of various occupations, traders, those who
serve other people, even those who may have tread the path of ill-will and misbehavior.
		</text>
		<text>
It goes without saying that people who tread the path of virtue, who seek to
worship Me, who administer on My behalf - they can equally take refuge by being
devoted to Me.
		</text>
		<text> 

You, Arjuna, are here in this temporary
world.
		</text>
		<text> It is bombarded by the three types of miseries- those inflicted by
others, those inflicted by ourselves, those brought on by effects beyond our
limits.
		</text>
		<text> Hence, it lacks peace.
		</text>
		<text>

You are here to administer on My behalf.
		</text>
		<text>
Worship Me.

Next, the Lord describes the
characteristics of bhakti:

		<text> [manmanA] Keep your mind in Me always.
		</text>
		<text> [madyAjI] Worship Me alone.
		</text>
		<text> [mAm namaskuru] Surrender to Me, [matparAyaNa:] have Me as your ultimate

		</text>
		<text> [Evam] In this way, [AtmAnam yuktvA] by attaching your thoughts
to Me, [mAm Eva EShyasi] you
will certainly attain Me.
		</text>
		<text>



'Keep your mind in Me always' - Like the
unbroken flow of oil, have an unbroken stream of thought that stays in Me.
		</text>
		<text> 

I am the Lord of Lords, The One abode of
all that's favorable, without a hint of a blemish.
		</text>
		<text> I am The One who knows
everything.
		</text>
		<text> My every intent is fulfilled.
		</text>
		<text> I'm The Single Cause behind the
entire universe, The Supreme Creator, The best among Men.
		</text>
		<text> 

My eyes are wide and pure like lotus leaves.
		</text>
		<text>
My appearance is like a flawless dark-blue cloud.
		</text>
		<text> I have the brightness of a
thousand suns that rise simultaneously.
		</text>
		<text>

I am a great ocean of tasty nectar.
		</text>
		<text> I have
four gentle and large arms; I wear a yellow garment of great brilliance,
decorated with a flawless crown, ear-ring, a garland, with bracelets on the
biceps and forearms.
		</text>
		<text> 

I am an abode of enormous favorable
qualities, limitless compassion, beauty, charm, generosity, grandeur and an
innate nature to look at everyone equally with an ocean of affection; 

I am a refuge for the entire universe
without exception, accepting everyone who seeks refuge without considering any
of their peculiarities.
		</text>
		<text>

I am the controller of everything.
		</text>
		<text> 

Again, the Lord emphasizes - 'Be My
devotee, have your thoughts stationed in Me with a limitless amount of love
towards Me'.
		</text>
		<text> Once more, the emphasis is laid with the instruction 'Worship Me
alone'- Experiencing Me is unlimited and uninterrupted joy.
		</text>
		<text> With such an experience,
return to My worship always.
		</text>
		<text>

Worship is to let-go and run with the will
of The Lord.
		</text>
		<text> Indeed, all actions like serving someone, transacting and
experiencing are all different forms of serving the Lord.
		</text>
		<text> In this way, you will
dedicate yourself to My worship - worship that is done out of excessive and
unbroken affection towards Me, arising from your experience of Me.
		</text>
		<text> 

In the same way, keep your thoughts in Me.
		</text>
		<text>

Once again, the instruction is emphasized
as - [mAm namaskuru]: Occupy
yourself with an intense and abundant spirit of surrendering to Me.
		</text>
		<text> Do this
without opposing or intending to terminate the surrender - This surrender comes
from an excess of affection towards Me - it comes from experiencing Me with
limitless and uninterrupted joy.
		</text>
		<text>

'Have Me as your ultimate goal': The person
who has Me as the ultimate goal is incapable of supporting himself without Me,
hence he takes My refuge.
		</text>
		<text>

With this, fasten your mind and have Me as
your ultimate goal.
		</text>
		<text> With an unbroken, limitless affection towards me, you get a
mind that's capable of experiencing Me.
		</text>
		<text> With it, you will attain Me.
		</text>
		<text> You do
this by thinking and meditating upon Me with your mind, experiencing and
adoring Me, surrendering to Me and having Me as the ultimate goal.
		</text>
		<text>

Do your activities that are necessary to
sustain your body, perform the duties prescribed in the scriptures and your daily
routine.
		</text>
		<text> Do them for My pleasure, as work that I've effected, with My service
as the driver.
		</text>
		<text> Always repeat My praise, be in the effort to achieve Me and
surrender to Me out of love.
		</text>
		<text> Resolve that the entire universe is subject to My will.
		</text>
		<text>
Being in My service is its only desire.
		</text>
		<text> Think of all My qualities.
		</text>
		<text> They give
vast amounts of joy.
		</text>
		<text> Be present daily in this world and worship Me in the
manner described before.
		</text>
		<text> You will definitely achieve Me.

Unfortunately, nobody
knows the Lord

People have varying levels of ability and
awareness to recognize the universe beyond their senses.

		<text> A scientist may
recognize the existence of an atom; a sage may recognize the spiritual force
behind life.
		</text>
		<text> Yet, they do not know My greatness.
		</text>
		<text> They do not know Me, My real
form, My name, My actions, My characteristics and so on.
		</text>
		<text> 

That's because I am the origin of all gods and great thinkers.
		</text>
		<text> I am the origin of
their form, their knowledge and everything else.
		</text>
		<text> Powerful people, gods and great sages are in
their positions due to their virtuous deeds.
		</text>
		<text> I have given them varying
awareness in accordance with those deeds.
		</text>
		<text> 

Their awareness has limitations.
		</text>
		<text> With this
limited knowledge, they do not know My characteristics in their true sense.
		</text>
		<text> 

The Lord's true characteristics cannot be
recognized by thought, even by powerful gods.

Next, the Lord says that the awareness of
His true characteristics shall free us from our misfortune - Our misfortune prevents
us from starting our journey of bhakti.

[martyEShu]
Among humans, [yO asammUDha: vEtti] a person who is free of misconceptions knows [mAm ajam anAdim cha] Me to be without birth
and without an origin, [lOkamahEshvaram] the Lord of the universe.
		</text>
		<text> [sa:] Such a person [pramUchyatE] is freed from [sarva pApai:] all misfortune.
		</text>
		<text>



The Lord is without birth, He was never
born.
		</text>
		<text> In this He is distinct from all inanimate things that keep transforming.
		</text>
		<text> 

He is also distinct from the Self, which is
attached to the material environment.
		</text>
		<text> The Self gets associated with the material
world in accordance with its past deeds.
		</text>
		<text> This association is called 'birth'.
		</text>
		<text>

The Lord has no such birth - This
distinction is described here with the word [ajam].
		</text>
		<text> The phrase 'without an origin' means that the Lord is not someone
who has attained freedom from birth and death.
		</text>
		<text> Those who
have attained such freedom do have an origin, in that they attained freedom after
being bound in the material world.
		</text>
		<text> 

This is also evident from the [shvEtAshvatara upanishat], 6-19, where it says that the Lord exists without
discontinuity.

In this Shloka, the Lord states - A person
who knows Me in this way - as the Lord of the entire universe who is untouched
by any flaw - is free of misconception.
		</text>
		<text> 

'Misconception' is to consider the Lord as similar to something
else.
		</text>
		<text> Unfortunately, such misconceptions prevent the start of bhakti.
		</text>
		<text> The person who does not have this opinion is
free from misconception.
		</text>
		<text> Such a person is free from all misfortune that prevents
the start of bhakti.
		</text>
		<text> 

Any other wealthy or powerful leader is like
another human.
		</text>
		<text> The person has attained that wealth and power due to deeds
committed in the past.
		</text>
		<text> Same is the case with the gods, their superiors and Brahma, the
principal engineer of the universe.
		</text>
		<text> They are subject to the influence of the three qualities too.
		</text>
		<text> The Lord is described as 'The
one who created brahma' in [shwEtAshvatara upanishat], 6-8.
		</text>
		<text>

Similarly, a wealthy person also belongs to
the same category of people who are bound to the environment.
		</text>
		<text>

The Lord of the universe is distinct from
all causes and effects we see in inanimate things.
		</text>
		<text> He is distinct from all conscious
beings, whether free or bound in the environment.
		</text>
		<text> 

The Lord has the distinction of having
absolute control, being the terminator of all misfortune, the single supreme
controller and the single abode of an infinite variety of abundant favorable
qualities.
		</text>
		<text> The person who knows the Lord in this way doesn't think of the Lord as
being similar to something else.
		</text>
		<text> This person is completely free of all misconceptions
and misfortune.
		</text>
		<text>

In this way, the Lord described the removal
of misfortune that prevents the birth of devotion.
		</text>
		<text>
Such misfortune is removed by a study of the Lord's characteristics.
		</text>
		<text> He also
said that the mere removal of such misfortune leads to devotion,
which then springs forth by itself.
		</text>
		<text>

Next, the Lord describes the growth of
devotion by studying His attributes, His wealth and the world of auspicious
qualities that reside in Him.
		</text>
		<text>

Let's get to know
the Lord

]

[pr'thak vidhA:] The various [bhAvA:] emotions [bhUtAnAm bhavanti] that take place in all beings [matta Eva
bhavanti] arise from Me alone - [buddhi] recognition, [jnAnam] cognition, [asammOha:] freedom from misconception, [kShamA] forgiveness, [satyam] truth, [dama:]
control over voluntary actions, [shama:] control over oneself, [sukham du:kham] comfort, discomfort, [bhava:] the state of having plenty, [abhAva:] the state of discontent, [bhayam] fear [abhayam Eva cha] and fearlessness too, [ahimsA] the desire to avoid harming anyone, [samatA] the attitude of equanimity, [tuShTi:] contentment, [tapa:] focus, [dAnam] charity,
[yasha:] fame [ayasha:] and infamy.
		</text>
		<text>



In the commentary that follows, each of the
aspects in this Shloka are explained as a state of our being and our experience
of that state.
		</text>
		<text>

There are different emotions, experiences
and states-of-being - 

The feeling of 'recognition' happens when
the brain notices similarity to something it knows.
		</text>
		<text> 'Cognition' is the
experience of 'knowing' and identifying different conscious beings and
non-conscious things

'Freedom from misconception' is to be free
of ignorance and bias, which dull our ability to make distinctions.
		</text>
		<text> For
example, ignorance about jewelry would make us bundle gold and pearl together.
		</text>
		<text>
Bias would prevent us from learning the distinction between them.
		</text>
		<text> When we are
free from bias and ignorance, we are free from misconception.
		</text>
		<text>

'Forgiveness'
is a state where our mind isn't deformed even in the presence of agitation.
		</text>
		<text>

'Truth' is to say it 'as it is', in a way
that's beneficial to the listener.
		</text>
		<text> It is stated here as a tendency that enables
us to do this.
		</text>
		<text>

'Control over voluntary actions' is to
desist from unfavorable subjects.
		</text>
		<text> Similarly, 'control over oneself' is the
experience of controlling our thoughts and feelings- instead of being
controlled by them.
		</text>
		<text>

'Comfort' is the experience of things which
are favorable to us, while 'discomfort' is the experience of something unfavorable.
		</text>
		<text>

'The state of having plenty' is a state of
mind that causes the feeling of comfort.
		</text>
		<text> 'The state of discontent' is fatigue
in our mind, which causes an unfavorable experience.
		</text>
		<text>

'Fear' is discomfort that comes from perceiving
the cause of future misfortune.
		</text>
		<text> 'Fearlessness' is to be free of such fear.
		</text>
		<text>

The 'desire to avoid harming anyone' is the
state of not being the cause of any misery.
		</text>
		<text>

The 'attitude of equanimity' is to view fortune
and misfortune equally- whether it happens to us, to people we adore, or to those
who oppose us

With the quality of 'contentment', we are
always joyous towards everyone.
		</text>
		<text>

'Focus' is to be engaged in the occupation
prescribed for us, even when comfort and enjoyment are restrained.
		</text>
		<text>

'Fame' is when we're known for virtuous
qualities; 'Infamy' is to have a reputation of lacking virtue.
		</text>
		<text> Here, 'fame' and
'infamy' indicate the dual states of our mind associated with such reputations.
		</text>
		<text>

Similarly, the other virtues mentioned,
such as 'focus' and 'charity' refer to our preferences and tendencies.
		</text>
		<text> 

All of us in this world keep going through
these emotions, experiences and states-of-being.
		</text>
		<text> The Lord says - 'These
emotions arise from Me'.
		</text>
		<text> Meaning, they are according to the Lord's will.
		</text>
		<text>

In the next Shloka, the Lord says that the powers behind this world are also subject to His
will.

[sapta maharShaya:] The seven great sages, [pUrvE] our ancestors [mAnasA jAtA:] born of Brahma, [tathA] along with [chatvArO manava:] the four Manus [madbhAvA:] are an expression of My will.

		<text> [imA: prajA:] All these descendants [yEShAm] from them [lOkE] live

		</text>
		<text>



Our ancestors, the seven great sages, including
Bhrgu came into being from an idea of Brahma, the principal engineer of the
universe.
		</text>
		<text> Their purpose was to keep the act of creation going.
		</text>
		<text> They ensured
continuity from the previous manvantara to this
one.
		</text>
		<text>

To sustain the world, four Manus
came into being.
		</text>
		<text> Their progeny now fills this world.
		</text>
		<text> 

Till the time of destruction, they play
their part as producers and caregivers to the next wave of conscious beings.
		</text>
		<text> 

The Lord states- Sages such as Bhrgu and
the Manus are an expression of My will.
		</text>
		<text> My intent itself is their intent.
		</text>
		<text> They
exist according to My policies.
		</text>
		<text> They follow My intentions.

		</text>
		<text> [na atra samshaya:] Let there be no doubt about this.

The Lord gifts His
awareness to those who want Him

The expanse of the Lord's unlimited power is
such that the creation, state-of-being and the very existence of everything is
subject to His will.
		</text>
		<text> 

He says- 'A person perseveres with unwavering,
focused devotion when he knows My associations in
their true form - I associate with great favorable qualities, I destroy all
that's unfavorable.
		</text>
		<text> Let there be no doubt in this matter'.
		</text>
		<text>

He goes on to state- 'You will see for
yourself- when you are aware of My powers and the vast expanse of My favorable
qualities, your devotion to Me is enhanced' - that
is the opinion expressed here.
		</text>
		<text> 

Next, the Lord illustrates a state of devotion.
		</text>
		<text> We enter this state when the awareness about
His qualities attains maturity.

The Lord says - 'I am the cause of creation

Those who know will recognize
that every being initiates activity with My stimulation.

		<text> They have conviction
that I have this unlimited power by My very nature; that I have abundant
favorable qualities such as affection, beauty and an equitable outlook towards

They are filled with feelings of adoration

		<text> They worship Me as the One with all favorable qualities.

The Lord describes the characteristics of
their worship with the phrase: 'their awareness is dedicated to Me' - meaning,
their mind is placed in The Lord; 'Their life runs with Me as the basis' - meaning,
they are unable to sustain themselves without The Lord.

He continues- They experience My qualities
in their own ways.

		<text> They share awareness about such qualities among their
friends.

Due to compassion [tEShAm Eva]

For the benefit of these very people, who desire
to be united with Me always, I stand as the subject of their thoughts.
		</text>
		<text> Standing
in this way, I reveal My own favorable qualities and destroy darkness with the
bright light of knowledge.
		</text>
		<text> 

Here, 'darkness' is the tendency to shift
attention towards material things, avoiding Me.
		</text>
		<text> This tendency stifles
knowledge.
		</text>
		<text> It is born out of ignorance grown with past deeds.
		</text>
		<text> The 'bright light
of knowledge' is My awareness, which gets rid of that tendency.
		</text>
		<text>

In this way, Arjuna listened to the expanse
of the Lord's wealth and the variety of His favorable qualities.
		</text>
		<text> These qualities
are unique to the Lord.
		</text>
		<text> They are in a different league altogether.

		<text> Listening to
them generates limitless joy.

[arjuna uvAcha] Arjuna said- 

[sarvE r'Shaya:] All great thinkers who are devoted to You [tathA
dEvarShi: nArada:] along with the divine sage Narada, [asita:] the dark, unbound [dEvala:] pious [vyAsa:] Vedavyasa [Ahu: tvAm] say that You are [param brahma] the supreme might, [param dhAma] the ultimate abode, [bhavAn paramam
pavitram] You are the supreme purity, [puruSham] the greatest personality, [shAshvatam] ever-lasting, [divyam] unaffected by the material world, [AdidEvam] the root of all powers, [ajam] the One who is not created [vibhum] and the One with irresistible will.
		</text>
		<text>
[svayam bravIShi mE] You tell this
to me [chaiva] directly as
well.
		</text>
		<text>



The Lord's qualities
cannot be understood.
		</text>
		<text> So how do we think of Him?

Arjuna says to Krishna - 'The scriptures
speak about the supreme might, the ultimate abode and the supreme purity.
		</text>
		<text> You
are that'.
		</text>
		<text> 

Here are the scriptures that speak about these
qualities:

[taittariya
upanishad], 3-1-1 speaks about the Lord in the neuter
gender- 'From which all these beings originate, by which
all beings take birth and live, in which they reside at the end - know It as
the Mighty One, which is to be worshipped'.
		</text>
		<text>

[taittariya
upanishad], 2-1-1 says what happens to the worshipper- 'The
person who worships this Mighty One will attain that very Might'

[muNdOkya
upanishad], 3-2-6 says it as well- 'The one who
worships and sees the Lord will attain equality to the Lord'.
		</text>
		<text>

Arjuna continues - The One who is called
the 'ultimate abode' is You alone.
		</text>
		<text> Here, the word 'abode' indicates the state
of enlightenment.
		</text>
		<text> The ultimate form of enlightenment is described in the
following scriptures -

[ChAndOgya
upanishat], 3-13-7 describes
the state-of-being enlightened with the Lord's awareness- 'It is the enlightenment that shines many times brighter than this
daylight'.
		</text>
		<text>

[ChAndOgya
upanishat], 8-12-2 describes the person who is
enlightened- 'Having attained the ultimate
enlightenment, he comes forth in his own form'.
		</text>
		<text>

[br'hadArAnyaka
upanishat], 4-4-16 describes how he is viewed- The powerful
consider Him as the brightness in everything that's bright.
		</text>
		<text>

Likewise, the Lord is the supreme purity -
One who purifies all.
		</text>
		<text> To a person who remembers Him, the Lord grants freedom
from disgrace and related mistakes.
		</text>
		<text> As said in the scriptures -

[ChandOgya
upanishat], 4-14-3 speaks about such a person's
mistakes- 'Mistakes do not stick to a person who worships this way, just as
water does not stick to a lotus leaf'.
		</text>
		<text>

[ChandOgya
upanishat], 5-24-3 speaks about vice in such a person-
'Just as cotton gets burnt into ashes when it falls
into fire, all vice in this person gets burnt away'.
		</text>
		<text>

[mahAnArAyaNa],
21-3 talks about the supreme nature of the Lord- 'Narayana is the supreme might.
		</text>
		<text> Narayana is the supreme element.
		</text>
		<text>
Narayana is the supreme enlightenment.
		</text>
		<text> Narayana is the supreme Self'.
		</text>
		<text>

Arjuna continues- Great thinkers know the
true nature of everything perceptible and non-perceptible.
		</text>
		<text> O Lord, they say You
alone are the everlasting divine person, the origin of all powers, You are without an origin.
		</text>
		<text> You are the
One who is all-pervading.
		</text>
		<text> The sage Narada and the unbound pious Vedavyasa too
say the same.
		</text>
		<text> From the scriptures -

[harivamsha,
vishNu parva], 123-62 describe Lord Krishna- 'This Narayana has the sea of milk as his mansion, has Lakshmi by his
side.
		</text>
		<text> He has left his serpent that serves as his resting place and has come
down to Mathura city'.
		</text>
		<text>

[bhArata.
		</text>
		<text>araNya.
		</text>
		<text>],
86-28,25 says- 'The city of
Dwaraka is indeed fortunate, because Lord Krishna is present there.
		</text>
		<text> He is the
Lord who can be seen, He is beginning-less, He is indeed the eternal and
supreme law'.
		</text>
		<text>

[bhArata.
		</text>
		<text>vana.
		</text>
		<text>],
76-24,28 describes those who know Krishna- 'Learned people who know the Vedas, those who are aware of the
knowledge of the Self say that the great Lord Krishna is the eternal and
supreme law.
		</text>
		<text> Govinda is the purest of the pure, the highest among all virtues and
the most favorable among everything that's auspicious.
		</text>
		<text> The Lord is the entire
universe and all the powers in it.
		</text>
		<text> He is
ancient, older than everything else.
		</text>
		<text> The Lord Hari, who cannot be grasped by
thought, is now present here as Krishna.
		</text>
		<text>

In [bhArata.
		</text>
		<text>vana.
		</text>
		<text>], 90-28,32, Krishna Himself tells Arjuna- 'Wherever the ancient and supreme
being, Lord Narayana is present, that's where the entire world is.
		</text>
		<text> It is home,
with all the wholesome rivers.
		</text>
		<text> Such a place is virtuous.
		</text>
		<text> It is a place of
focused thought.
		</text>
		<text> That is itself the ultimate entity, which extends through-out
the universe.
		</text>
		<text> It is a place of powerful scholars, people with great
achievements and those who have focused their thoughts.
		</text>
		<text>.
		</text>
		<text>.
		</text>
		<text> Lord Krishna, present
as the origin of all power and as the great performer, is the most favorable of
all places.
		</text>
		<text> Have no doubt in this matter'.
		</text>
		<text>

[bhArata.
		</text>
		<text>sabha.
		</text>
		<text>],
38-33 echoes- 'Lord Krishna himself is the creation and
destruction of all the worlds.
		</text>
		<text> Along with everything with consciousness and
without, this entire universe exists only for His purpose'.
		</text>
		<text>

Finally, Arjuna recalls what Krishna said-
'You have said so Yourself, in Chap.7#4: This universe of Mine
is divided into eight categories: Solids, liquids, gasses, energy, space, mind,
the gross collections and the notion of individuality.
		</text>
		<text> Up until Chap.10#8:
People with this knowledge worship Me with the conviction that I am the origin
of everything; Each and every entity gets stimulated with the initiative given
by Me.
		</text>
		<text> They are filled with feelings of adoration for Me'.

Your association with greatness - such as
the act of creation - was described briefly, starting with Chap.10#8: 'I am the
origin of everything; each and every entity gets stimulated with the initiative
given by Me '.
		</text>
		<text>

Please elaborate this again, along with the
extent of Your might and span of control.

great qualities as described by You.

prAdhAnyata: kurushrEShTha nAstyantO

		</text>
		<text>

]

[shrI bhagavAn uvAcha] Lord Krishna said [hanta] Good! [kurushrEShTha] Arjuna, [kathayiShyAmi] I will tell [tE]
you [prAdhAnyata:] what stands
out in the [shubhA:] favorable [Atmana: vibUtI:] expanse of My might and My
irresistible will.
		</text>
		<text> [nAstyanta:]
There is no end [mE vistarasya]
to My expanse.
		</text>
		<text>



Lord Krishna says- 'Arjuna, I will tell you
what stands out in the favorable expanse of My might'.
		</text>
		<text> Here, the phrase 'what
stands out' is used to mean 'the most important and the most distinguished'- in
other words, the chief and the special aspects of His might.
		</text>
		<text> 

This flows in later in this chapter as well
(Chap.10#24) - 'I am the chief of the priests and advisors'.
		</text>
		<text>

The specialties of the
Lord are endless

Lord Krishna says - 'I will now tell you
the most famous manifestations of My might in this world - The entire expanse
of My might is endless, so it's not possible to speak about it or listen to its
elaboration'.
		</text>
		<text>

The Lord's 'might' refers to His absolute
ownership of the universe.
		</text>
		<text> Earlier in this chapter, after
saying that the power to reason and other states-of-being come from Him, the
Lord states in Chap.10#7: 'The person who knows this expanse
of My unlimited power and My associations - such a person sets to work and
performs with unwavering focus and discipline'.
		</text>
		<text> There, the word 'association'
meant Lord's association with His activities such as the act of creation.
		</text>
		<text> The 'might'
of the Lord is his pervasive ability to stimulate everything into activity.
		</text>
		<text>

Again, in Chap.10#8, the
Lord says - 'People with this awareness worship Me with the conviction that I
am the origin of everything; that each and every entity gets stimulated with
the initiative given by Me.
		</text>
		<text> They are filled with feelings of adoration for Me'.
		</text>
		<text>

The Lord's control manifests as the
stimulus for the activity in all beings.
		</text>
		<text> He controls by being present as the
Self in each being.
		</text>
		<text> This is the way in which He pervades all beings and stimulates
them into action- including their creation, sustenance and destruction.
		</text>
		<text> This is
His yoga.
		</text>
		<text>

aham Adishcha madhyam cha bhUtAnAm

]

[guDAkEsha] Arjuna,
[aham] I am [sthita:] situated in [sarva bhUta] all beings [Ashaya] at their core [AtmA] as the Self.
		</text>
		<text> [cha
aham] Moreover, I am [Adi:] the beginning, [antya cha] as well as the end [madhyam Eva cha] and everything in-between.
		</text>
		<text>



All beings are present as My body.
		</text>
		<text> I am present at the core of all
beings, inside the region of their heart.
		</text>
		<text> I am present as their Self.
		</text>
		<text> By
'Self', I mean the basis of existence, the controller and owner of the body in
every way.
		</text>
		<text> 

The Lord elaborates this in further
chapters as well.
		</text>
		<text> In Chap.15#15: I am at the heart of everything.
		</text>
		<text> Knowledge,
memory and the ability to reason come from Me'.
		</text>
		<text> 

In Chap.18#61, He says: 'Arjuna, the Supreme
Lord sits at the heart of every being, spinning all beings, mounting them in
the mechanism of the environment'.
		</text>
		<text>

[br'hadArAnyaka],
5-7-15 describes everything as the Lord's body: 'The
One who is present in all beings, who is distinct from all of them, the One
whom all beings do not know, the One who has all beings as His body, the One who controls all beings
while being inside them - He is inside you too; He is the Self that doesn't
perish'.
		</text>
		<text>

[shatapatha],
14-5-30 states that the Self is also the Lord's body:
'The One who is present inside the Self, who is distinct from the Self, the One
whom the Self does not know, the One who has the Self as his body, the One who controls the Self
while being inside it - He is the One who is within you and regulates your
feelings; He is the Self that does not experience death.
		</text>
		<text>

In this way, being present as the Self in all beings, I am their
beginning, their end, as well as everything in-between.
		</text>
		<text> Meaning - I am the
ultimate cause of their creation, sustenance and destruction.
		</text>
		<text>

In the same way, the Lord explains that
every word is synonymous with the Lord, since He is present as the Self inside
everything.
		</text>
		<text> Knowing that every word addresses the Lord is a way to establish
the uniqueness of His mighty expanse.
		</text>
		<text> 

Indeed, all words ultimately conclude in
the Lord, since they have the Lord as their 'Self'.
		</text>
		<text> They have the Lord as the
basis and essence of their existence.
		</text>
		<text> While words such as 'person', 'bird',
'tree' are used to describe the material forms of those things, they address
the 'essence' that constitute their being - their Self.
		</text>
		<text> 

The Lord says that all words are bound to
address Him, due to the fact that the Lord is present
as the Self- the essence and the basis inside everything.
		</text>
		<text> 

The Lord sums up His expanse in Chap.10#39:
'An object in which I'm not present as its Self does not exist'.
		</text>
		<text> This is a
statement of fact- it's impossible for anything to exist without the Lord being
its basis.
		</text>
		<text>

Further, He states that this existence is
subject to His will in Chap.10#8: Each and every entity gets stimulated with
the initiative given by Me.
		</text>
		<text>

From the next Shloka till the end of
this chapter, the Lord illustrates several ways to relate to His greatness.
		</text>
		<text>

You experience the Lord
whenever you experience something special

Among the stars, I appear as the moon

Here, the word 'among' is not used in the
sense of being 'one among', nor is it used to indicate that the Lord is special
among similar things.
		</text>
		<text> Rather, it illustrates how the Lord is distinct in His
pervasiveness and superiority, while being in the midst of everything.
		</text>
		<text> For
instance, while the moon is present among the stars, the experience of moon-shine
is especially intimate in contrast to distant starlight.
		</text>
		<text>

Continuing on the same thread, He says in
the next Shloka: 'I am the consciousness in all beings'.

Even over here, the word 'among' is not
meant to differentiate the Lord among similar things.

		<text> Rather, it is used to
express how He stands out in the midst of other things and how He is at the
core of everything.

Further, the Lord says - Among the

[arjuna]
Arjuna, [yat chApi] whatever [bIjam] is the source [sarva bUtAnAm] of all beings, [tat aham] I am that.
		</text>
		<text> [tat na asti] It is impossible [charAcharam bhUtam] for any being, moving
or stationary, [yat syAt] to
exist [mayA vinA] without Me.
		</text>
		<text>



There is a huge variety of beings in this
world.
		</text>
		<text> They exist in various different states.
		</text>
		<text> Whatever is the cause of these states of existence - whether seen or unseen - that is Me.
		</text>
		<text> It
is impossible for anything to 'be', without Me being present as its Self.
		</text>
		<text> 

The Lord started on this fact in Chap.10#20,
where He stated- 'I am situated in all beings at their core as the Self'.
		</text>
		<text> He
continued up until this Shloka, in which He says that it's impossible for anything
to exist without Him.
		</text>
		<text> 

The Lord illustrated that He resides in
everyone as the ultimate Self.
		</text>
		<text> 

All types of things in all states of
existence have the Lord in their essence - He is the One we speak of, when we call
anything by a name.
		</text>
		<text> In this way, the Lord announces the fact that 'He is
present as the Self in everything'.
		</text>
		<text> That is how He is the basis for everything
in the universe, He has simultaneous equivalence to everything and all words
address Him.

universe, [EkAmshEna sthita:] which

What's the need to elaborate this knowledge
I speak about? With a miniscule portion of My unbounded control, I pervade everything.

		<text>
Accordingly, the entire universe does not step outside My will - including
everything in it, conscious and non-conscious.

I pervade them in every state - in the
state of being a raw material or a finished product, being perceptible or
imperceptible, in all their different forms, in steadfastness and in action to
change.
		</text>
		<text>

As stated in [vishNu purANa], 1-9-53 by Parashara: One characteristic of the
Lord is the ability to control without boundaries.

		<text> One part of this unbounded
control - the part is also unbounded - has the ability to pervade and control the

Until now, the Lord described His presence as
the Self in everything, along with all His
favorable characteristics, all unique to Him.
		</text>
		<text> He did this to start our association with devotion and to enhance it.

From this, we know that the entire universe

conscious and non-conscious.
		</text>
		<text> Their form, state and activity
are subject to His will.
		</text>
		<text> The Lord is distinct from every other type of thing.
		</text>

Arjuna got to know these unique
characteristics of the Lord from the Lord Himself.
		</text>
		<text> He realized that the form,
state and activity of this entire universe are subject to His will.
		</text>
		<text> Affirming
this realization, Arjuna speaks of his desire to see the Lord in such a form.

		<text> The
Lord is pleased and Arjuna actually sees The Lord in this form.

All this will be described in this chapter.

[sanjaya uvAcha] Sanjaya narrated - [tatO rAjan] Then, my king, [EvamuktvA] having said this, [hari:] Lord Krishna - [mahA yOgEshvara:] who is the great Lord of yoga - [darshayAmAsa] showed [paramam] the ultimate [rUpam] beauty of His form [aishvaram] and His pervasive might [pArthAya] for the sake of Arjuna.
		</text>
		<text>



Sanjaya narrated to Dhrtarashtra - Having said
this, Lord Krishna, who had taken the responsibility of driving a chariot, who
is the master of astonishing characteristics, who is none other than the Supreme
Lord Narayana, showed the ultimate beauty that's unique to Him.
		</text>
		<text> He showed it in
all its pervasive might.
		</text>
		<text> 

The Lord shows this for the sake of Arjuna,
the son of Prtha, cousin on His mother's side.

The Lord's beautiful form is home to the
entire universe with its huge diversity.

The Lord showed His form.
		</text>
		<text> It has supreme
luster and shines with great brilliance.
		</text>
		<text> It is endless and timeless - It is
present during all the three stages of creation, sustenance and destruction.
		</text>
		<text> It
is also the abode in which the entire universe is situated.
		</text>
		<text> 

Hence, the Lord's form cannot be determined
in the constraints of space and time.

		<text> It faces every direction.
		</text>
		<text> The Lord's form
has decorations that suit its supremacy - clothes, aromas, garlands,

[tadA] Then, [pAnDava: apashyat] Arjuna saw [kr'tsnam jagat] the entire universe [anEkadhA pravibhaktam] with its manifold
variety [tatra] over there, [Ekastham] in one place [sharIrE] inside the body [dEvadEvasya] of the Lord of Lords.
		</text>
		<text>



This entire universe
forms a small part of the Lord's body

There, Arjuna saw the entire universe with
its manifold variety, in one place inside the body of the Lord.
		</text>
		<text> Arjuna saw this
with 'divine vision', which is the capability to see the Lord in this way,
obtained by the compassion of the Lord Himself.
		</text>
		<text>

The Lord's form has infinite length and
expanse.
		</text>
		<text> It has infinite arms, torsos, faces and eyes.
		</text>
		<text> It has limitless
brilliance, infinite weapons that are not bound by the material world, with
uncountable decorations that suit the Lord's form.
		</text>
		<text> It is adorned with extraordinary
garlands and aromas.
		</text>
		<text> 

In this limitless and astounding body of
the Lord, Arjuna saw the entire variety of the universe, which is classified in
many ways: Organisms that can experience things- such as powerful people, ordinary humans, animals,
stationary beings and so on; Places where things can be experienced: on the
earth, under the earth, in the sky, on other heavenly bodies, at bottomless depths,
below and above everything.
		</text>
		<text> 

Arjuna saw the variety of environments with
their varieties of experiences and instruments that enable each experience.
		</text>
		<text>

Arjuna saw the Lord as He described
Himself, beginning at Chap.10#8 'I am
the origin of everything; Each and every entity gets
stimulated with the initiative given by Me', continuing in Chap.10#19
'I will tell you what stands out in the favorable
expanse of My might and My irresistible will', Chap.10#21 'In the powers of nature, I am Vishnu, the all-pervasive', Chap.10#39 'It is impossible for any
being, moving or stationary, to exist without Me',
finishing with Chap.10#42 'I support
and control this entire universe, which is situated in one part of My being'.

Lord is to be known and grasped - as stated in [muMdaka], 1-1-4: 'Two pieces of knowledge are to be known - the material and the

In this Shloka, Arjuna says to Krishna -
'The One who is mentioned in the Upanishads as the supreme, ever-lasting person
is You.
		</text>
		<text> You are the ultimate basis of this universe.

		<text> You do not wear out.

[anAdi madhya antam] Without a beginning, middle and an end, [ananta
vIryam] with limitless valor, [ananta
bAhum] with endless arms, [shashi
sUrya nEtram] with eyes of the sun and the moon, [dIpta hutAsha vaktram] with a mouth that
resembles a blazing fire, [pashyAmi tvAm] I see You, [tapantam] energizing [idam vishvam] this universe [sva tEjasA] by Your authority.
		</text>
		<text>



Arjuna describes the Lord as having no
beginning, middle or end, having vast unbounded valor - the quality of valor is
mentioned merely as an example.
		</text>
		<text> It is meant that the Lord is the abode of vast,
unbroken spans of knowledge, force, power, valor, strength and brilliance.
		</text>
		<text> 

The phrase 'endless arms' is used as an
example to refer to the Lord's uncountable arms, torsos, feet, faces and so on.
		</text>
		<text>


'The eyes of the sun and the moon' describe
the all-pervasive eyes of the Lord, which are pleasant as the moon or scorching
as the sun.
		</text>
		<text> The Lord is pleasant to the virtuous who surrender to Him; He is
scorching to others, who always look for their own benefit and don't mind
hurting others.
		</text>
		<text> This is said in Chap.11#36: 'The virtuous
surrender to the Lord, while people who exploit for personal gain scatter and
run in fear'.
		</text>
		<text> 

'A mouth that resembles a blazing fire'
refers to the Lord's capability to consume the entire universe during its
destruction.
		</text>
		<text> The Lord energizes this universe by His authority - The word
'authority' refers to the Lord's ability to exercise control over anything.
		</text>
		<text>
Having realized this, Arjuna says to the Lord - I see You energizing this
universe by such authority.
		</text>
		<text>

Arjuna realizes the Lord as being
ever-present - as the creator of everything, as the basis of existence, as the
one who controls everything, as the one who destroys everything, as an ocean of
limitless qualities such as knowledge and compassion, with a body that's not
related to any material, being without a beginning, a mid-point or an
end-point.
		</text>
		<text> Arjuna tells the Lord - I have realized You in the same way as You
described Yourself before.
		</text>
		<text>

You can imagine the
Lord anyway you like

How do we imagine a single body with many
torsos and the like? We picturize it as the Lord having a hip of huge size,
above which many torsos, heads and so on are present.
		</text>
		<text> Below this, many divine
feet.
		</text>
		<text> It is even possible to imagine the many eyes as being two eyes in each of
the many heads.
		</text>
		<text>

Any form that lends itself to express
the ever-present Lord with absolute control over the entire universe can be
imagined.
		</text>
		<text> There is no limit to such imagination.
		</text>
		<text> Every such imagination is right.
		</text>
		<text>

Next, Arjuna tells the Lord - Looking at
You in this manner, I am greatly disturbed, along with others who see You in this
way.

form in this way.
		</text>

'The space that spans the earth and
heavenly bodies' indicates everything above us and everything below.
		</text>
		<text> The space above
and below contains the entire universe.
		</text>
		<text> In this Shloka, Arjuna addressed the
Lord as the Mighty One, whose volition cannot be deciphered.
		</text>
		<text>

Arjuna says- the whole of this space and
all possible directions are pervaded by You.
		</text>
		<text> 

Your form is astounding and fearsome with
an unending expanse.
		</text>
		<text> It has extreme splendor, great intensity and ferociousness.
		</text>
		<text>
On seeing this, three types of people are greatly disturbed- the favorable,
unfavorable and the indifferent.
		</text>
		<text> They include all those who came to see the
war, such as the various powers, the generous, the selfish, the demons, the
benevolent, the sages and elders - all of them are extremely frightened.
		</text>
		<text> 

All these people were granted divine vision
similar to the one granted by the Lord to Arjuna.
		</text>
		<text> It was for all of them to see
His form, which is the abode of the entire universe.
		</text>
		<text> With what intent was it
given? It was given to demonstrate the Lord's complete and absolute sovereignty
to Arjuna.
		</text>
		<text> 

(The demonstration is that the Lord can
give whatever he wishes to anyone without any motive.
		</text>
		<text> He inspires awe in
everyone, no matter how powerful they are or what they think of the Lord)

The Lord encompasses
the whole world with all His activities.
		</text>
		<text> 

In response to this, Arjuna says - Mighty Lord,
looking at this form of Yours, which is both astounding and fearsome, all kinds
of people are greatly disturbed.

[mahAbAhO] Lord
with powerful arms, [dr'ShTvA]
seeing [mahat tE rUpam] this
huge form of Yours, [bahu vaktra nEtram] with many faces and eyes, [bahubAhu] many arms, [uru pAdam] thighs and feet, [bahUdaram] with many torsos, [bahu damShTrAkarAlam] many canine teeth, [lOkA: pravyathitA:] people are scared.

		<text> [aham cha] so am I.
		</text>
		<text>



At times we experience
the universe as being terrible, due to the influence of past deeds.
		</text>
		<text>

Looking at Your form, with many canines and
this terrifying appearance, all these people are extremely scared - whether they
are favorable, unfavorable or indifferent.
		</text>
		<text> Along with them, I'm scared too.

[viShnO] Lord
Vishnu, you pervade everything.
		</text>
		<text> [na vindAmi] I lost [dhr'tim]
the ability to sustain myself [shamam cha] and lost my tranquility [dr'ShTvA] on seeing [tvAm]
You.
		</text>
		<text> [nabha: spr'sham] You
touched the sky [dIptam anEka varNam] with many brilliant colors, [vyAttAnanam] with open mouths, [dIpta vishAla nEtram] with huge sparkling eyes.
		</text>
		<text> [pravyathita
antarAtmA hi] Indeed, my very being is shaken.
		</text>
		<text>



The 'sky' mentioned in this Shloka is the
abode of the Lord.
		</text>
		<text> It is a space that doesn't deform, as stated in the Upanishads:
'The sky in which the imperishable is present'.
		</text>
		<text>

The same is stated in the [purushasukta]: 'The One who is the color of the Sun and is beyond the material
world'; in [yajurvEda], 2-2-12-68: 'The One who is outside this perishable world - a world pervaded
by the quality of rajas'; in [aShTa], 2-8-9-6: 'The space, which is the abode of the ultimate controller'.
		</text>
		<text>

So the word 'sky' talks about the ultimate
space, which is beyond this material world and its three
qualities.
		</text>
		<text> The Lord is the abode and refuge of everything, including
inanimate things that keep transforming, as well as personalities that keep
changing their nature.
		</text>
		<text> 

Indeed, the Lord pervades everything above
and below.
		</text>
		<text> 

Arjuna says - Seeing You with many
brilliant colors, with many open mouths and huge sparkling eyes, my very being
is shaken - I am so scared that I can't stand firm.
		</text>
		<text> It feels like nothing can
support my body.
		</text>
		<text> I do not find any peace in my mind or in my organs.
		</text>
		<text> O Vishnu,
the all-pervasive, seeing You pervading everything in this astonishing and
terrible form, I have lost control over my organs.
		</text>
		<text> All my limbs are frail.

[tE] Your [mukhAni] faces [damShTrAkarAlAni] seem cruel with their terrible canines.
		</text>
		<text> [kAlAnalasannibhAni]
They are equivalent to the great fire that brings
ultimate destruction.
		</text>
		<text> [dr'ShTvaiva] Just by seeing, [dishO na jAnE] I cannot recognize any of the directions [sharma

		</text>
		<text> [dEvEsha] O Lord of the gods [jagannivAsa] in whom all the worlds reside, [prasIda] be pleased.
		</text>
		<text>



Your terrible faces are involved in
destroying everything like the great fire which devours everything at the end
of a yuga.
		</text>
		<text> Seeing them, I have lost my sense of direction
and I don't find any comfort.
		</text>
		<text> O Lord of all gods
and powers, in whom all the worlds reside, be pleased - return me to my
original state - That is the desire expressed here.
		</text>
		<text>

In this way, Krishna demonstrated that the
universe depends on Him for its continued state of being and functioning.
		</text>
		<text> He
demonstrated that He alone will get the burden of this earth down, as per His
liking.
		</text>
		<text> 

He does this by destroying the elements
that intend to cause harm for personal gain, who are in the guise of kings on
either side - standing by the sons of Dhrtarashtra or joining hands with
Yudhishtira.
		</text>
		<text> 

Arjuna witnessed the overwhelming power of
the Lord, His capability of creation and other activities.
		</text>
		<text> He saw a form that contains
everyone inside it.
		</text>
		<text> He saw the destruction of Dhrtarashtra's sons and others in
the Lord's form.
		</text>
		<text> 

Arjuna could see this destruction - even
though it hadn't taken place yet - with the divine sight presented to Him by
the Lord.
		</text>
		<text> Having seen this, Arjuna says:

Arjuna concludes-

Lord, I asked You to show Your entire form
with unbounded power (Chap.11#4).
		</text>
		<text> That resulted in
uncovering this highly terrifying form.

		<text> Tell me, what is the purpose of this

You.

the reason why this terrible form was uncovered, please assume Your original
pleasant form again.

Lord Krishna demonstrated His ownership of
the entire universe.

		<text> This demonstration came from His limitless affection toward
those who take refuge in Him.

The Lord, when asked about the motivation to
uncover this terrible form, tells His motive in the next Shloka- My terrible
form was uncovered as a reminder that even without Arjuna's efforts, I Myself
have set out to kill all these kings headed by the sons of Dhrtarashtra.
		</text>
		<text> The
intention of this reminder is to set Arjuna to work in His occupation of war.

'You are the imperishable, You are the outcome and the origin' and in Chap.10#39 'You are the wind, restraint, fire, the

Without knowing this, whatever I said in irreverence
- out of carelessness, out of familiarity that comes out of association, out of
friendship, thinking of You as a companion of my age, addressing You as 'Hey

while having fun, when we were doing things together by ourselves or in a

[sanjaya uvAcha] Sanjaya said - [tathA] Then, [iti uktvA]
having said this [arjunam] to
Arjuna, [mahAtmA vAsudEva:] the
great Krishna [darshayAmAsa]
showed [svakam rUpam] His form [bhUya:] again.
		</text>
		<text> [AshvAsayAmAsa
cha] He then reassures [Enam
bhItam] this frightened soul [bhUtvA] by being [soumya vapu:] with a gentle body.
		</text>
		<text> 



Having said this to Arjuna, The Lord showed
His familiar form having four arms, born as the son of Vasudeva.
		</text>
		<text> 

The great Lord's intent is always fulfilled.
		</text>
		<text>
Arjuna was frightened by the sight of an unfamiliar form, so the Lord reassured
him by regaining His familiar gentle form.
		</text>
		<text> Having four arms is the familiar
form of the Lord, the supreme person who was born as the son of Vasudeva with
the intention of favoring the world.
		</text>
		<text> 

At birth, Krishna was requested by His
father Vasudeva, who was afraid of Kamsa, to withdraw two of His hands.
		</text>
		<text> The
hands were withdrawn till Kamsa was killed.
		</text>
		<text> After that, they appeared in their
natural form.
		</text>
		<text> 

Vasudeva's prayer is described in [vishNu purANa], 5-7-10 / 13: 'You are born, O Lord of gods, carrying Your conch and the disc.
		</text>
		<text>
Be pleased and withdraw this divine form of Yours.
		</text>
		<text> Withdraw this form of Yours
having four arms, O Lord who owns the universe'.
		</text>
		<text> 

Shishupala, who hated the son of Vasudeva,
always had Krishna's four-armed form in his mind as the object of hatred, as
said in [vishNu
purANa],
4-15-13: 'The One with four long and large arms,
holding the conch, disc and the mace'.
		</text>

It is the same four-armed form that Arjuna
talked about, when He wanted to see the Lord's familiar form.

A person without devotion wouldn't be able

		<text> I am not seen merely by following the scriptures,
by instruction, by teaching, by studying, by listening, by chanting and by achievements
such as ceremonies, rituals, charity and penance.
		</text>
		<text> 

With single-minded devotion alone, it is
possible to know Me from the scriptures as I truly Am, to see My true form and
to actually enter Me.
		</text>
		<text> As said in the [kaTha upanishat], 2-23: 'This
Self is not realized by teaching, not by intelligence, not by listening about
it many times.
		</text>
		<text> It is realized by the one whom it chooses.
		</text>
		<text> This Self shall
reveal itself to such a person'.
		</text>
		<text>

The 'Self' mentioned here is the Lord, who is the Ultimate Self of the
universe.
		</text>
		<text> From this it is known that the Lord only reveals Himself
to the one He chooses.
		</text>
		<text> Of course, this brings a question: Does this not sound
arbitrary? Whom does the Lord choose? The answer is: The Lord chooses those who
choose the Lord - those who are devoted to Him, as said in this Shloka itself (Chap.11#54).

		</text>
		<text> Such a person works with Me as
the only objective - due to excessive affection towards Me.
		</text>
		<text> 

Due to this single-minded affection towards
Me, such a person will not tolerate attachment towards anything else - he is
without attachment.
		</text>
		<text> 

This person is without hatred towards any
being - it is in his nature to feel content when he is with Me and feel sorrow
when I am not in his thoughts.
		</text>
		<text> Due to this, he considers his own offences as
the instrument that causes sorrow in him.
		</text>
		<text> In this way, the person would not
consider any other being as the cause of his sorrow, hence wouldn't have
feelings of hatred towards anyone or anything.
		</text>
		<text> 

The person who exists in this manner shall
achieve Me - he attains Me in My true being.
		</text>
		<text> By getting rid of all ignorance
and all flaws without a trace, he experiences Me alone.
		</text>

		<text>Chapter 12

Arjuna wished to see the unbounded expanse
of the Lord's pervasive power, which is realized by commitment to devotion.
		</text>
		<text> The Lord showed him this power in its
entirety.
		</text>
		<text> 

Though the human senses cannot perceive such
unbounded power, it was experienced.
		</text>
		<text>

This experience was due to the Lord's
ability to realize all that He desires.
		</text>
		<text> The Lord enabled this experience from
His unbroken, unlimited expanse of compassion, generosity, amiable nature and
other favorable qualities.
		</text>
		<text> 

It was also stated that single-minded devotion with ultimate love is the only
way to know and see the Lord in His actual form.
		</text>
		<text>

Next, The Lord states that His worship in
the form of devotion is superior in comparison to
the quest
for the Self.
		</text>
		<text> The superiority of devotion lies
in the speed of realizing its goal, in the ease and in the simplicity of its
practice.
		</text>
		<text> 

Let's devote
ourselves to the Lord

This chapter describes the practice of the
Lord's worship along with its accessories.
		</text>
		<text> It also describes the quest of the
Self for people who are incapable of worship.
		</text>
		<text> 

The Lord's worship is indeed superior -
this is by virtue of the Lord's superiority, as said in Chap.6#47:
'The person who worships Me, having placed himself within Me with complete
trust - I consider him to be the most focused, even in comparison to all those
who persevere to realize the Self'.

]

[arjuna uvAcha] Arjuna said- [Evam] In this way, [yE]
those who are [bhaktA:] devoted to You [paryupAsatE
tvAm] worship You well.
		</text>
		<text> [cha
api] On the other hand, there are also people [yE akSharam] who focus on the
indestructible, which we know as our Self, [avyaktam] which is not perceptible to our sense organs.
		</text>
		<text> [tEShAm kE] Who among them [yOgavittamA:] is closer to realizing their
goal?



How do we realize our goal? By being devoted to it, or by
knowing everything about it?

At the end of the previous chapter, in Chap.11#55, the Lord said: 'The person who dedicates all his
actions to Me shall achieve Me'.
		</text>
		<text>

In this chapter, Arjuna begins by
responding to the Lord- 

Your devotees
consider their ultimate goal to be You, in the manner You described- with all
Your powers, with vast, unbroken amounts of limitless qualities like beauty,
equanimity, all-knowing and always having Your intent fulfilled.
		</text>
		<text> These devotees
worship You completely.
		</text>
		<text>

On the other hand, there are people who
dedicate their effort towards the realization of the indestructible, which is
evident as the Self inside each of us, which is otherwise imperceptible to our
eyes and other sense organs.
		</text>
		<text>

Who is closer to realizing their goal: your
devotees, or those who pursue the realization of the Self? Who will realize their
goal sooner? In this Shloka, Arjuna uses the word [yOgavittama] to ask about the speed at which the goal is realized.
		</text>
		<text>

This is answered further in this chapter (Chap.12#7) - 'I'll be there without delay for those who
have placed themselves in Me'

[shrI bhagavAn uvAcha] Lord Krishna said - [yE] People who [mAm upAsatE] worship Me [mayi AvEshya mana:] by committing their mind in Me [nitya

		<text> [upEtA:] They are endowed with [parayA shraddhayA] complete trust and dedication.
		</text>
		<text> [mE matA] I consider [tE] them
[yuktatamA:] to be closest to
Me.
		</text>
		<text> 



The Lord commences His response- 

Being devoted is to
trust and be with the Lord, recognizing that He is the ultimate purpose

People who commit their minds to Me do so with
complete trust and dedication.
		</text>
		<text> They worship Me with extreme affection, with a
desire to be with Me always.
		</text>
		<text> I consider such people to be closest to Me.
		</text>
		<text> 

Meaning- they will reach the ultimate goal
easily, without delay.
		</text>
		<text> I am the ultimate goal.

		</text>
		<text> [sarvatragam] The object of their focus is present in every body.
		</text>
		<text> [anirdEshyam] It is inscrutable.

		<text> [sarva

		</text>
		<text> 

[hi] Nevertheless,
[adhikatara: klEsha:] it's
extra tough [tEShAm] for them [Asakta chEtasAm] to focus their interest on
[avyakta] the 'unmanifest'.
		</text>
		<text> [avyaktA gati:] The goal of realizing the unmanifest
Self [avApyatE] is achieved [du:kham] with great difficulty [dEhavadbhi:] by those who are predisposed
to consider their body as themselves.
		</text>
		<text>



Knowing is about
deciphering ourselves and our relationship with the Lord

Here, the words 'perpetual' and
'unmanifest' refer to the Self, which is self-evident in each of us.
		</text>
		<text> 

It is inscrutable.
		</text>
		<text> Since it's distinct from
the body, it can't be described by words that are used to describe the body.
		</text>
		<text>
For instance, being male, female, ordinary or powerful doesn't describe its
properties in any way.
		</text>
		<text>  Hence, it's not perceived by sight, speech or any of
our senses.
		</text>
		<text> 

This Shloka states that it is present in
every body and cannot be deciphered by thought.
		</text>
		<text> Though the Self is present in
the body, it doesn't have any characteristics of the body.
		</text>
		<text> Hence, it cannot be
deciphered in terms of those characteristics.
		</text>
		<text>

By being distinct from the body, it remains
unchanged like an anvil, even though its body keeps changing.
		</text>
		<text> By this, the characteristics
of the Self remain unaffected by all the effects of its body.
		</text>
		<text> By virtue of
remaining constant, it is termed as being 'unmoved and steadfast' in this Shloka.
		</text>
		<text>

Our body is a community of organs.
		</text>
		<text> When people
focus on the Self, they control the body well.
		</text>
		<text> They employ their organs such as
sight and hearing, instead of transacting to pursue their satisfaction.
		</text>
		<text>

They have an attitude of universal
equanimity.
		</text>
		<text> While we perceive huge variety in our bodies, they know that the
Self inside all bodies is present in the form of pure knowledge - no matter how
small, large or powerful the being is.
		</text>
		<text>

With this attitude, they wish everyone
well.
		</text>
		<text> They are free from all intentions that cause harm.
		</text>
		<text> That's because the
intention to harm is a limitation, which comes by considering inequalities.
		</text>
		<text> The
Self in each of us is identical.
		</text>
		<text>

By focusing on the Self, they will
certainly attain Me - in addition to realizing their Self.
		</text>
		<text> This is stated in
Chap.14#2: 'Having gained this knowledge, they achieve My characteristics'.
		</text>
		<text> It
is also stated in the [muMDaka upanishat], 3-1-3: [niranjana: paramam sAmyam upaiti] - 'Devoid
of flaws, it attains ultimate equality with the Lord'.
		</text>
		<text>

Though the Self is permanent and achieves
ultimate equality with the Lord, it remains distinct.
		</text>
		<text> This is said in Chap.15#16:
'The Self stays without deforming and is said to be the imperishable', going on
to Chap.15#17: 'However, the Supreme Person is another one'.
		</text>
		<text> 

The [mundaka upanishat], 1-1-5 narrates: A sage called Shyavanaka went to another sage called Angirasa
and asked to be taught.
		</text>
		<text> Angirasa started his teaching with the statement:
'There are two types of learning, the material and the superior.
		</text>
		<text> Material
science is about observations and creativity in the universe'.
		</text>
		<text> He goes on to
say: 'Superior learning is the awareness by which the Supreme Lord can be
attained'.
		</text>
		<text> 

This teaching is called [akShara vidya] - 'The science of the perpetual'.
		</text>
		<text> In the [akShara vidya], the word 'perpetual' has been used to denote the Supreme Lord, rather than the Self.
		</text>
		<text> The
Supreme Lord is described to be the creator of all beings.
		</text>
		<text> 

The word [akShara] - 'the perpetual' - has been used in the scriptures, to mean the
Self in some places and the Lord in others.
		</text>
		<text> Even then, the Self and the Lord
remain distinct - The Lord creates all beings and the Self does not.
		</text>
		<text>

Nevertheless, it's extra tough to focus
interest on the unmanifest Self.
		</text>
		<text> The goal of realizing the Self is reached with
great difficulty, while being associated with a body.
		</text>
		<text> We are predisposed to consider
our body as our Self.
		</text>
		<text>

Next, the Lord clearly asserts that He is
always there for His worshippers.

Deciphering the Self is
tough.
		</text>
		<text> Entrust yourself to the Lord - He accepts you directly.
		</text>
		<text>

The whole material world engages in
activity.
		</text>
		<text> Activities such as eating are material activities, which are needed
to sustain everyone's journey in their body.
		</text>
		<text> Then there are activities
prescribed to everyone - such as charity, rituals and meditation.
		</text>
		<text> 

Those who dedicate all these activities to
Me are the people who worship Me.
		</text>
		<text> They do so along with the dedication of their
reasoning and intent.
		</text>
		<text> They are conscious about the true nature of the Self,
desiring nothing but union with Me, without attachment to
other benefits.
		</text>
		<text> 

They dedicate their thoughts to me with prayer,
praise and worship, considering these activities themselves to be extremely enjoyable.
		</text>
		<text>
Their performance itself is the benefit.
		</text>
		<text>

Without any delay, I will save them from
all that prevents them from attaining Me.
		</text>
		<text> I will save them from the sea of this
material world, which is bound by cycles of death.

		<text> It's an

Enjoy repeatedly, while thinking about My

[madyOgam Ashrita:] While being devoted to Me, [atha] in case [ashakta: asi] you are unable [Etat kartum api] to do this as well, [tata:] then [tyAgam kuru] leave
[phala] the outcomes [sarva karma] of all actions.
		</text>
		<text> [yatAtmavAn] Be a person who perseveres.
		</text>
		<text>



While being devoted to Me, let's say you're
unable to do this as well - meaning, you're unable to work for Me with devotion.
		</text>
		<text> Let's say you're unable to cultivate unwavering
love towards Me, being unable to constantly keep thinking of My qualities.
		</text>
		<text>

In case you are unable to do all of this,
embrace the pursuit of the Self.
		</text>
		<text> This was described in the first six chapters.
		</text>
		<text>
Such pursuit generates ultimate devotion.
		</text>
		<text> As
described in those chapters, be without attachment to the outcome of all
actions.
		</text>
		<text> 

Your love towards Me gives rise to the
intention of achieving Me, only when all flaws have withered away.
		</text>
		<text> Keep
persevering, irrespective of your senses and their desires.
		</text>
		<text>

Do your activities without attachment to their
outcomes.
		</text>
		<text> Do them solely as My worship.
		</text>
		<text> Such activities enable you to focus on
the Self.
		</text>
		<text> With this focus, your ignorance and all other obstacles are removed.
		</text>
		<text> 

You will realize that the Self exists for
My purpose alone.
		</text>
		<text> With this realization of the Self in you, ultimate devotion comes forth by itself.
		</text>
		<text>

Further, this is summarized in Chap.18#46:
'A person achieves the goal by worshipping Him with his actions', going on to
Chap.18#53: 'Being free of possessiveness, he gains peace and aspires to achieve equivalence to the Lord.
		</text>
		<text> Once he achieves this
equivalence, he gains joy.
		</text>
		<text> He is free from desire and sorrow.

to be equal, he gains ultimate devotion to Me'.

When it isn't possible
to adore the Lord or decipher the Self, work without
attachment

It's extremely difficult to practice the
Lord's thoughts without supreme love for Him.
		</text>
		<text> When compared to this difficulty,
the quest for the true nature of the Self, followed by its realization is more
effective in uplifting the Self.
		</text>
		<text> 

Realization of the Self is tough as well,
since the Self isn't really evident to us.
		</text>
		<text> In comparison, the method of
meditation - focusing thought on the Self to realize it - is special.
		</text>
		<text> 

However, even this isn't easy.
		</text>
		<text> In
comparison, working without attachment is superior
in its simplicity.
		</text>
		<text> Such work is a means to achieve the Self and the Lord.
		</text>
		<text>

People get rid of all flaws and gain
tranquility by working without attachment to outcomes.
		</text>
		<text> In such a tranquil mind,
they gain the ability to focus thoughts on the Self.
		</text>
		<text> With this focused thought,
they gain the realization of the Self.
		</text>
		<text> Ultimate devotion
comes from that realization.
		</text>
		<text>

In summary: Focusing on the Self is
definitely recommended for those who aren't capable of ultimate devotion.
		</text>
		<text> However,
focus isn't possible without a tranquil mind.
		</text>
		<text> In that case, it's preferable to just
work without attachment to outcomes - the knowledge of the Self is embedded in
such work.
		</text>
		<text> This helps in achieving the goal.
		</text>
		<text> 

The next Shloka describes the admirable
qualities of a person who is dedicated to working
without attachment to outcomes.

as the Self, [sama du:kha sukha:] with the same outlook towards comfort and discomfort, [kShamI] ever-forgiving, [satatam santuShTa:] ever content, [yOgI] being in touch with his Self, [yatAtmA] he exercises control over himself.
		</text>
		<text>
[dr'Dhanishchaya:] Being firm
in his conviction, [arpita] he
dedicates [buddhi: mana:] his
mind and intellect [mayi] in
Me.
		</text>
		<text> [yO madbhakta:] Such a
devotee of Mine [sa mE priya:]
is dear to Me.
		</text>
		<text>



A devotee of the Lord has no hatred towards
any being - including those who hate him and those who are unfavorable.
		</text>
		<text> Such a
person knows that some will dislike him and be unfavorable sometimes.
		</text>
		<text> He
considers it to comes from past misdeeds.
		</text>
		<text> The Lord wills them to behave this
way.
		</text>
		<text> 

Hence, he is friendly towards all beings,
including those who are unfriendly and are seen to cause harm.
		</text>
		<text> He has
compassion towards those who suffer.
		</text>
		<text> 

He doesn't have any possessive feeling
towards his body, his organs or anything related to them.
		</text>
		<text> Since he is without
the confusion that his body is his Self, he has the same outlook towards
comfort and discomfort - he is without ecstasy and agony in the presence of
favorable and unfavorable sentiments that are willed by the Lord.
		</text>
		<text> 

Even when this devotee encounters unavoidable
forms and feelings, he doesn't get agitated.
		</text>
		<text> He has an attitude of tolerance
and forgiveness.
		</text>
		<text> He is cheerful, being content with whatever is obtained to
sustain his body.
		</text>
		<text> 

He is always in touch with his Self,
constantly recognizing that it is different from the environment.
		</text>
		<text> He has
control over his mind.
		</text>
		<text> He believes in scriptures that deal with the Self and
Me.
		</text>
		<text> 

He has dedicated his mind and intellect to
Me.
		</text>
		<text> He has conviction that I am the One who is worshipped by working without attachments, knowing that he will realize
the Self by this worship.
		</text>
		<text> 

This devotee of mine, who worships Me with karmayOga, is
dear to Me.

agitated, [ya:] who [na udvijatE] doesn't get agitated [lOkAt] by this world, [ya: mukta:] who is free [harShAmarSha bhaya udvEgai: cha] from ecstasy,
anger, fear and agitation - [sa mE priya:] Such a person is dear to Me.
		</text>
		<text>



In this Shloka, the Lord describes another
kind of person who is dear to Him-

The world does not get agitated when this
person works without attachment, simply being the instrument in an action.
		</text>
		<text>

This person doesn't do anything to distress
others.
		</text>
		<text> This person does not get agitated by the world.
		</text>
		<text> The world, having
determined that he does no harm to anyone, will not do anything to agitate him.
		</text>
		<text>

This comes from the belief that nothing is
adverse- everything happens for My purpose.
		</text>
		<text> With this, he is free of ecstasy,
anger, fear or agitation towards anyone.
		</text>
		<text> This type of person is also dear to Me.

do not affect a person who works without attachment.

Neither does he experience hate, when deprived of such experiences.

normally cause sorrow in humans.

Starting with Chap.12#13, The Lord
described the virtues of leaving hatred towards enemies and attachment to friends,
along with other characteristics of a devotee.
		</text>
		<text> Though redundant here, the Lord
emphasizes the virtue of 'being unbiased', even when in the company of desire.
		</text>
		<text> 

In this Shloka, the Lord states- A person
who has firm conviction in the Self is not bound by needs - such as the need to
'belong' to a place of residence.
		</text>
		<text> By the same conviction, he is unbiased in
situations of fame and disgrace.
		</text>
		<text> Such a devotee is dear to Me.

focus on the Self.

this person, just as He did at the beginning of this chapter.

		<text>Chapter 13

The first six chapters described Krishna as
the Supreme Lord and the ultimate achievement.
		</text>
		<text> To achieve
Him, those chapters described devotion as a part
of the Lord's worship.
		</text>
		<text> They also described the techniques of contemplation and activity
as 'means' to achieve that devotion.
		</text>
		<text>  

The second set of six chapters described
The Lord as the ultimate goal, His true form and His greatness.
		</text>
		<text> They
recommended abundant and single-minded love for Him in the form of devotion.
		</text>
		<text>
Awareness of the Lord leads to such devotion.
		</text>
		<text>

It was also stated that devotion is
effective in achieving great wealth in this world, the curiosity to experience
the Self and other goals as well.
		</text>
		<text>

Devotion in this
world

The next six chapters offer clarity about
the material environment and the Self.
		</text>
		<text> They also describe how their combination
forms this world.
		</text>
		<text> These chapters also clarify the methods to achieve our goal, along
with the associated actions, awareness and devotion - which were stated in the
last twelve chapters.
		</text>
		<text>

This is the thirteenth chapter and it
describes the nature of the Self and the body.
		</text>
		<text> This chapter clarifies the true
nature of the body and lays down the means to achieve the Self, separate from
the body.
		</text>
		<text> It gives clarity on the characteristics of this Self.
		</text>
		<text> 

This chapter also explains why the Self is
attached to inanimate matter.
		</text>
		<text> It describes methods to distinguish these
attachments.

Etat yO vEtti tam prAhu: kShEtrajna
iti tadvida: || 1 ||
		</text>
		<text>

]

[shrI bhagavAn uvAcha] Lord Krishna said- [kauntEya] Arjuna, [idam sharIram] this body [abhidhIyatE] is said to be [kShEtram] the field of action.
		</text>
		<text> [tadvida:] People who know it [prAhu:] call [yO vEtti] the
one who is aware of [Etat] this
body [kShEtrajna iti] as the
knower of the field.
		</text>
		<text>



This
body tends to be equated to the Self, resulting in opinions such as 'I am
powerful', 'I am human', 'I am fat' or 'I am thin'.
		</text>
		<text> 

However, the body and the Self are
distinct.
		</text>
		<text> The Self is the one who experiences.
		</text>
		<text> This body is to be experienced
by the Self.
		</text>
		<text> That's why the body is called the 'field' where experiences are
made - those who know the true nature of the body say this.
		</text>
		<text>

The person who is aware of this is known to
have distinguished the Self.
		</text>
		<text> He is aware of something inside, which says 'I
know this', while being covered by organs and being in association with them.
		</text>
		<text>

The person who has realized the true nature
of the Self recognizes that the body is to be known, that the Self is the
'knower' and is distinct from the body.
		</text>
		<text>

The knower of the body
is not the body, it is the Self.
		</text>
		<text>

When we deal with things that are separate
from our body - such as a clay pot - it is common to distinguish it from
ourselves.
		</text>
		<text> We're aware that 'I am a human' and that 'I know it's a pot'.
		</text>
		<text>  

While we tend to equate the one who knows -
the Self - with our body, we still perceive that we know our body.
		</text>
		<text> We realize
that 'I know my body'.
		</text>
		<text> This is illustrated in experiences which make us say
things like 'I feel pain in my stomach'.
		</text>
		<text>

Like the pot, the body is separate from the
Self.
		</text>
		<text> The Self is the one who 'knows' and the body is the one which is 'known'.
		</text>
		<text>
Thus, the body is distinct from the Self.
		</text>
		<text> Likewise, the Self is distinct, being
the 'knower of the field'.
		</text>
		<text> It is the knower of the body and the environment.
		</text>
		<text>

The belief that they both are equivalent
comes from the presentation of the body as an inseparable attribute of the
Self, like 'cowness' is an inseparable attribute of a cow.
		</text>
		<text> 

The unique qualities of the Self, as the
knower, are not apparent to organs such as our eyes.
		</text>
		<text> Our minds are formed by
contact with the environment, with the environment being a source of
experiences.
		</text>
		<text> People who don't know the nature of the Self and the environment
see the body as the 'knower'.
		</text>
		<text> The body is actually a part of the environment.
		</text>
		<text>

As said in Chap.15#10: 'The body is a
product of the three qualities.
		</text>
		<text> Ignorant
people are unable to recognize the Self - The Self is the one who experiences.
		</text>
		<text>
Its experiences are painted with these three
qualities, while being in the body and initiating activities like eating.
		</text>
		<text> While
in ignorance, they are unable to recognize that the Self departs from the body
at the time of death.
		</text>
		<text> 

On the other hand, those who have the sight
of knowledge do see this Self as being distinct'.

		<text>



The following commentary illustrates the
relationship of the environment, the body and the Lord.
		</text>
		<text> Name anything in the environment;
it has a Self embedded in it.
		</text>
		<text> The environment needs a Self to be recognized.
		</text>
		<text> In
that context, the body is an inseparable attribute of the Self.
		</text>
		<text> The Self uses
the body to experience the environment.
		</text>
		<text> The Lord is the controller.
		</text>
		<text> Though the
Self and the environment exist as the body of the
Lord, they are distinct with their own characteristics.
		</text>
		<text> However, the Lord has
said in this shloka: Know me to be the knower.
		</text>
		<text> Does it mean He is the Self
within us? Or is the Self distinct from the Lord? To clarify this, many
scriptures are quoted, many questions are asked and answered in the following
commentary.
		</text>
		<text>

That which knows the
Self is the Lord.
		</text>
		<text> Doesn't that make the Self redundant? Is it same as the Lord?

The capability to 'know' is the single
characteristic of the Self in every body.
		</text>
		<text> It doesn't depend on the
characteristics of the body - whether it's ordinary, powerful, intelligent, ugly
or beautiful.
		</text>
		<text>

The Lord is the essence of the Self.
		</text>
		<text> Krishna
tells Arjuna to know this.
		</text>
		<text>

In this Shloka, the phrase 'as well' in the
statement 'Know Me to be the knower as well' implies that the Lord must be
known as the 'knower' as well as the 'field of action'.
		</text>
		<text> 

A living body merely qualifies the Self and
doesn't exist without it.
		</text>
		<text> When we point out someone's body, we address their
Self.
		</text>
		<text> They are both referenced in the same way.
		</text>
		<text> Similarly, the body and the
Self exist as inseparable attributes of the Lord.
		</text>
		<text> The Lord refers to the Self
as Himself in this Shloka.
		</text>
		<text>

Our body is a combination of the five elements
of the environment - solids, liquids, energy, gasses and space.
		</text>
		<text> Both our body
and the Self exist as the body of the Lord.
		</text>
		<text>
They don't have any other existence.
		</text>
		<text> In other words, both of them have the Lord
as their essence.
		</text>
		<text> 

This is stated in many scriptures, which
are listed here:

The [br'hadArAnyaka, 3-7-3] states: 'The One who is inside all matter, while being distinct it; The
One whom matter cannot encode; The One who has all matter as his body; The One who controls all matter
from the inside - Such a Self is all-pervasive and ever-lasting'.
		</text>
		<text> 

Starting with that statement, it finishes
describing the concept in [br'hadArAnyaka, 3-77-22]: 'The One
who is present inside the Self, who is distinct from the Self; The One whom the
Self does not know; The One who has the Self as His body; The one who controls
the body from within - that is the essence of your Self, it is ever-lasting'.
		</text>
		<text>

The Lord is all-pervasive and is present as
the essence of every Self.
		</text>
		<text> Hence, when we point out anything, we are actually
addressing the Lord.
		</text>
		<text> It is stated in the following Shlokas:

Chap.10#20: 'I am situated in all beings at
their core as the Self.
		</text>
		<text> Moreover, I am the beginning, as well as the end and
everything in-between'

Chap.10#39: 'Whatever is the source of all
beings, I am that.
		</text>
		<text> It is impossible for any being, moving or stationary, to
exist without Me'

Chap.10#42: 'I support and control this
entire universe, which is situated in one part of My being.
		</text>
		<text>'

In the second half of the tenth chapter, the
Lord described that he is the Self, the essence of everything.
		</text>
		<text> In the midst of that
description, the Lord described Himself as many special things by saying 'I am
Vishnu', 'I am the sun' and so on.
		</text>
		<text> For instance, He says in Chap.10#21: 'In the
powers of nature, I am Vishnu, the
all-pervasive.
		</text>
		<text> In all luminous things, I am the sun that has the greatest
brightness.
		</text>
		<text> Among the powers of war, I am the most powerful.
		</text>
		<text> Among the stars, I
appear as the moon'

The difference between kshetra and
kshetrajna and the fact that I am the Self to both of them - that is the awareness
you must have.
		</text>
		<text>

In this Shloka, He says - 'Learn to differentiate
the field of action and the one who
experiences this field.
		</text>
		<text> I recommend you to realize that I am the essence of
both'.
		</text>
		<text>

The following paragraph tries out an opposing
explanation, which ends in contradiction.
		</text>
		<text>

In this Shloka, the Lord has said - 'Know
Me to be the knower'.
		</text>
		<text> This can be interpreted as a statement of equivalence, to
mean that the Lord and the Self are the same entity.
		</text>
		<text> The Self within us hasn't
realized that it is the Lord.
		</text>
		<text> This leads to the conclusion that the Lord, being
present as the Self, does not realize Himself to be the Lord - due to
ignorance.
		</text>
		<text> 

We could hypothesize that such statements
of equivalence are meant to get rid of such ignorance: For example, we may
mistake a rope to be a snake.
		</text>
		<text> When someone shows us that it's only a rope, our
ignorance is gone.
		</text>
		<text> In the same way, what if our awareness that 'I am aware and
I'm distinct from the Lord' is ignorance and this Shloka aims to remove such
ignorance?

Now the contradiction is presented.
		</text>
		<text>

Those who argue in this manner say that the
Lord and the Self are the same entity.
		</text>
		<text> They are to be questioned: 'The Lord,
who has taught us all this - Lord Krishna - is He free from the so-called 'ignorance',
which says that the Self and the Lord are distinct? Or not? 

If He is free of such 'ignorance', then His
Self has the characteristic of pure knowledge.
		</text>
		<text> Being devoid of any other
attribute, there is no possibility to consider Arjuna to be distinct from
Himself.
		</text>
		<text> Hence, there's no possibility to explain anything and get rid of
anyone's ignorance.
		</text>
		<text>

On the other hand, if we consider that
Krishna is not free of ignorance, not having realized the Self, then the
possibility to teach the subject of the Self does not arise.
		</text>
		<text> 

It was said in Chap.4#34: 'Those who know and show the way will preach
this knowledge to you' - people learn to be aware of
the Self.
		</text>
		<text> 

Thus, such arguments, which say that the
Lord and the Self are not distinct, go against the scriptures and other Shlokas
in the Gita itself.
		</text>
		<text> They make the great scriptures self-contradictory.
		</text>
		<text> They
must not be accepted, since they only serve to mislead everyone.
		</text>
		<text> 

What can we conclude from this
reasoning?

The concept to be grasped from this
discussion is: There exists inanimate matter, the conscious Self and the Supreme
Lord.
		</text>
		<text> Inanimate matter is to be experienced, the conscious Self is the one who
experiences and the Lord is the controller.
		</text>
		<text> 

Let's learn about the Lord, the Self and
the environment

There are many statements in the scriptures
that speak about their distinguishing characteristics:

[shwEtAshvatara
upanishad], 4-6 illustrates that the Lord is distinct
from those who are bound by their deeds: The
amazing Lord creates this universe out of the subtle
singularity at the time of creation.
		</text>
		<text> There is another, who is bound by his
past deeds.
		</text>
		<text>

[shwEtAshvatara
upanishat],
4-10 illustrates that the Lord and the environment
are distinct: Know this environment as an amazing
creation and the Lord as the amazing creator.
		</text>
		<text>

[shwEtAshvatara
upanishat],
1-10: The environment keeps changing.
		</text>
		<text> The one who
assumes that he is the enjoyer of environment is the unchanging Self.
		</text>
		<text> There is
One Lord who controls both of them.
		</text>
		<text> The Lord removes the ignorance that the
Self controls the environment.
		</text>
		<text>

[shwEtAshvatara
upanishat],
6-9: He is the cause; He is the Lord of the owner of
the body; Nobody has given birth to Him; Nobody has control over Him.
		</text>
		<text>

[shwEtAshvatara
upanishat], 6-13: He is the Lord of the environment and
the one who knows the field of action; He is the lord of the three qualities.
		</text>
		<text>

[shwEtAshvatara
upanishat], 1-9: He is the Lord of the universe and of
the Self; He is ever-lasting, auspicious and never diminishes.
		</text>
		<text> He is the unborn
Lord of those who know and those that don't.
		</text>
		<text>

[shwEtAshvatara
upanishat], 1-3: He is the ever-lasting consciousness
among the many ever-lasting consciousness, He is the one who grants their
wishes (meaning, the Lord is present inside the Self, present as the
ever-lasting entity in each conscious being, the One who grants their wishes).
		</text>
		<text>

[shwEtAshvatara
upanishat], 1-5: The one who experiences, that which is
experienced and the One who inspires everything - they are respectively the
Self, the environment and the Lord.
		</text>
		<text>

[shwEtAshvatara
upanishat], 1-6: The devotee
attains immortality through the Lord by pleasing Him.
		</text>
		<text> The Self is distinct, having the Lord as inspiration and purpose.
		</text>
		<text>

 [munDaka
upanishat], 3-1-1: Two birds are friends.
		</text>
		<text> They exist
together in a tree.
		</text>
		<text> One of them tastes the fruit of the tree, while the other
stays without eating, shining brilliantly.
		</text>
		<text> The tree is like our body.
		</text>
		<text> The
bird that tastes the fruit is the Self, which experiences the results of its
actions.
		</text>
		<text> The one that shines forth brilliantly is the Lord, who is not under
the influence of His deeds, hence does not have to eat the fruits of His
actions.
		</text>
		<text>

[shwEtAshvatara
upanishat], 4-5: The eternal three qualities - the white sattva, red rajas
and dark tamas - give rise to many bodies,
which are in turn loaded with those qualities.
		</text>
		<text> An eternal Self lies happily in
this environment.
		</text>
		<text> An eternal Self that practices devotion
leaves this environment.
		</text>
		<text>

[chUlakOpanishat],
5: The environment, which is without a beginning and an
end, gives rise to the bodies of all beings.
		</text>
		<text> 

[shwEtAshvatara
upanishat], 4-7: The Self is trapped in the body.
		</text>
		<text>
Without control, it is saddened due to ignorance.
		</text>
		<text> Once it realizes the other
controller inside the same body, it realizes The Lord in all His greatness.
		</text>
		<text> It
is gladdened and is rid of all sorrow.
		</text>
		<text>

These were some of the scriptures in which
the relation between the Self and the Lord is depicted, along with the fact
that they are distinct from each other and distinct from the environment too.
		</text>
		<text>

Let's look at our origin

Even in the Gita, there are many verses
that state the origin of the Self and the universe:

Chap.7#4, Chap.7#5: 'This universe of mine
is divided into eight categories: Solids, liquids, energy, gasses, space, mind,
the gross collections and the notion of individuality.
		</text>
		<text> However, this universe I
just described is not the ultimate one.
		</text>
		<text> Know My ultimate nature, which is
something distinct, in the form of a conscious being by whom this world is
sustained'

Chap.9#7, Chap.9#8, Chap.9#10: 'All beings
end up in a dormant state in My body at the end of a kalpa.
		</text>
		<text> Again, at the
beginning of the next kalpa, I create them in various forms.
		</text>
		<text> I
create this entire system of beings again and again, while keeping My material
nature as the basis.
		</text>
		<text> Since they are under the influence of the material world,
they are not free.
		</text>
		<text> These activities of mine don't bind Me.
		</text>
		<text> Being neutral, I
have no attachment towards those activities.
		</text>
		<text> The material environment guides
this world with all its stationary and mobile beings according to My will.
		</text>
		<text> I am
the supreme controller.
		</text>
		<text> This world goes through its cycles for this purpose
itself'

Chap.13#14: Know the environment and the
Self to be without a beginning.
		</text>
		<text>

Chap.14#3: This huge universe is my
creation.
		</text>
		<text> In that, I give birth.
		</text>
		<text> Then, the birth of all beings takes place.
		</text>
		<text>

Meaning - The huge universe arises from the
subtle matter, which is an attribute of mine.
		</text>
		<text> In this environment, which is
without consciousness, I place the womb of consciousness.
		</text>
		<text> This association of
the conscious Self and the non-conscious environment happens by My will.
		</text>
		<text> Such
association gives rise to all beings in the material world, from the mighty and
powerful right upto the immobile.
		</text>
		<text>

In this Shloka, the environment - the huge
universe - is called [brahma].
		</text>
		<text>
It doesn't mean that it's the same as The Lord, who is also called by the same
word.
		</text>
		<text> The word [brahma] is used
to refer to our environment in other scriptures as well.
		</text>
		<text> For example, [muMDaka] 1-1-9 says: 'From that, the universe called as [brahma], arises'.
		</text>
		<text>

In this way, the conscious and
non-conscious exist as those who experience and that which is experienced.
		</text>
		<text> They
exist in this way in all states of being.
		</text>
		<text> The Lord is the inseparable essence
of their existence.
		</text>
		<text> Several scriptures state this fact and they are quoted here
once again:

[br'hadArAnyaka], 3-7-3: The One who is situated in the earth and pervades it; The One whom
the earth does not know; The One whose body is
the earth; The One who controls the earth from its core.
		</text>
		<text> 

Let's look at our relationship with the
Lord.
		</text>
		<text>

Similarly, other scriptures describe how
the Lord is related to the Self:

[br'hadArAnyaka],
3-7-22: The One who is situated in the Self and
pervades it; The One whom the Self does not know; The One whose body is the Self; The One who controls the
Self from its core.
		</text>
		<text>

Identical statements are present in [subAla upanishat], illustrating that the universe, our environment and the Self are
the body of the Lord: 'The One who is active
inside the earth; The One whose body is the
earth; The One whom the earth does not know', 'The One who is active in the
Self; The One whose body is the Self; The
One whom the Self does not know' and 'The One who is active in the perishable;
The One whose body it is; The one whom the
perishable does not know.
		</text>
		<text> 

In this way, Lord Narayana is the core Self
of all beings, untainted by actions, distinct from the material world, shining
forth, the one and only supreme entity.
		</text>
		<text> 

This Upanishad uses the word 'perishable'
to refer to everything without consciousness, which existed in subtle form before creation.
		</text>
		<text> It is also called [tamas].
		</text>
		<text>
The usage of the word [tamas] to mean the subtle
environment is evident in the same Upanishad: 'The body perishes in the
Self and becomes subtle, taking the state of [tamas]'.
		</text>
		<text>

These statements are reiterated in in [ya.
		</text>
		<text>A], 3-11-2: 'The Lord is the Self inside everyone, controlling them'.
		</text>
		<text>

In this way, everything exists as the Lord's body, be it conscious or non-conscious,
in every state of being.
		</text>
		<text> In fact, everything is a form of the Lord Himself.
		</text>
		<text> The
Lord Himself exists as the origin of the universe, as a subtle singularity before creation.
		</text>
		<text> He exists as
the effect as well, which is the entire universe after creation.
		</text>
		<text> 

The Lord is both the effect
and the cause

Here are a few scriptures that remind us of
this fact.
		</text>
		<text> They state that both the cause and the effect are the Lord Himself:

Starting
with [ChAndOgya], 6-2-1: [sadEva saumyEdamagramAsIt
EkamEvAdvitIyam]

Prior to creation, this universe was
present as [sat] - a subtle
form, indistinguishable from the Lord.
		</text>
		<text> It alone existed, there was nothing
else.
		</text>
		<text>

[ChAndOgya], 6-2-3: [tadaikShata bahusyAm prajayEyEti tattEjO_sr'jata]

It willed to become many.
		</text>
		<text> It created energy
and the material world.
		</text>
		<text>

[ChAndOgya], 6-8-6: [sanmUlA:
sOmya imA: sarvAn prajA: sadAyatanA: satpratiShThA:]

It is the origin of everything and
everyone.
		</text>
		<text> It - this [sat] - is
the place of residence for all beings, The One in which all beings return when
the universe perishes.
		</text>
		<text>

[ChAndOgya], 6-8-7: [aitadAtmyam
idam sarvam tat satyam sa AtmA tat tvam asi shvEtakEtO]

This is at the core, present as the Self
inside everything.
		</text>
		<text> This is the truth.
		</text>
		<text> You are such a Self.
		</text>
		<text>

The [taittarIya], 2-6 starts
with 'He willed to be many beings.
		</text>
		<text> He gave thought to it.
		</text>
		<text> He created all of
this by his thought', going on to state: 'The Ultimate Consciousness became the
conscious and the non-conscious'.
		</text>
		<text>

This is repeated in the Chandogya Upanishad,
as in [ChAndOgya], 6-3-2:

I enter the core of the three powers -
energy, liquids and solids - and enable them to be called by names and be
recognized by form.
		</text>
		<text>

The [taittarIya], 2-6 also states:
Creating this universe, It entered and pervaded that universe itself; having
pervaded, It gave rise to the Self and its association with the environment,
the power to discern and the lack of it too.
		</text>
		<text> This [sat] is The Lord.
		</text>
		<text> He became the conscious Self and the non-conscious
environment.
		</text>
		<text>

Before the time of creation, only an undivided
entity existed without the possibility to distinguish and name anything.
		</text>
		<text> Only
after the Lord's act of creation, this entity was separated into things that
could be distinguished and named.
		</text>
		<text>

[br'hadArAnyaka], 1-4-7 also states the same:

All of this existed without being distinct,
before the time of creation.
		</text>
		<text> The Lord made them distinct, after which they
could be called by names.
		</text>
		<text>

Hence the gross universe, which is the
effect of creation, as well as the subtle cause
that existed before creation, all conscious and non-conscious things are the Lord's body.
		</text>
		<text> The effect is not
different from the cause.
		</text>
		<text> In this way, by knowing the cause, we know everything
that's created out of it.
		</text>
		<text> It is appropriate to say that knowledge of one gives the
knowledge of everything.
		</text>
		<text> 

For example: A pot is made out of clay.
		</text>
		<text>
It's possible to consider the pot as clay, while acknowledging that they have
different characteristics and uses.
		</text>
		<text> Knowing the properties of clay enables us
to know a pot and everything else that's made out of clay.
		</text>
		<text> 

Quoting [ChAndOgya], 6-3-2 again:

'I enter the three powers - energy, liquids
and solids - by being at the core of every Self and distinguish them to be
called by names' - The 'three powers' here denote the non-conscious elements in
the environment.
		</text>
		<text> The Lord enters them as the core of the Self in each object,
which enables them to be distinguished, recognized and named.
		</text>
		<text> 

In this way, every sound and expression
addresses the Lord, who is adorned with the Self and its inanimate matter.
		</text>
		<text> Thus
the Lord, who is present as the ultimate cause, has equivalence with everything
that's created - this is the primary meaning embedded here.
		</text>
		<text>

If the Lord has equivalence to
everything, does it mean He has ignorance as well?

It is already said that the Lord is the
material cause of the universe with its conscious beings and non-conscious
things.
		</text>
		<text> He is the subtle form before creation as well as the gross result of
creation - the universe we are in.
		</text>
		<text> Being the material cause implies that the
Lord Himself became the conscious Self and the non-conscious environment.
		</text>
		<text> 

Though the Lord has the Self and the
environment as His body, even though He is
the material cause of their association, He remains distinct from them - the
characteristics of the Lord are not mixed up with the characteristics of the
Self or the environment.
		</text>
		<text> 

How is it possible that the Self and the
environment remain distinct, even though they are part of the Lord's body? Here's an
analogy: 

Just as colorful threads that are white,
black or red come together to create cloth, the thread and the cloth remain
distinct with different characteristics.
		</text>
		<text> While threads are the only material
cause of a colorful cloth, each color is localized to the thread that went into
making the cloth - even in the resulting cloth, the colors don't mix.
		</text>
		<text> The
characteristics of the cloth are distinct from those of the threads.
		</text>
		<text>

The Self and the
environment are effects of the Lord's creation

The Self, the environment and the Lord combine
to be the material cause of this world.
		</text>
		<text> While they are effects of the Lord's
creation, their characteristics don't get mixed up.
		</text>
		<text> The Self remains the one
who experiences; the environment is the one that's experienced and the Lord is
the One who controls.
		</text>
		<text>

Threads, which normally remain separate,
are woven together at the will of a weaver at some instant.
		</text>
		<text> These threads are
both the material cause and the effect.
		</text>
		<text> 

Similarly, the Self and the environment in
all states of being - either the subtle form before creation or the gross form
after creation - are the body of the Lord.
		</text>
		<text>
They exist as entities only in the form of the Lord's
body.
		</text>
		<text> Their form is the Lord Himself, both as the cause and the observed
effect.
		</text>
		<text> He is the One addressed by all words, all the time - This is His specialty.
		</text>
		<text>


The environment, the Self and the Lord have
distinct characteristics - The environment is inanimate, without consciousness;
The Self is knowledge, which is limited in its expression according to the
actions committed by the Self; The Lord always has infinite knowledge.
		</text>
		<text> 

As in the case of threads combining to make
cloth, their characteristics remain distinct and don't get mixed up.
		</text>
		<text> Given
this, it's easy to recognize that the Lord's characteristic remains unchanged
even after He enters everything in the created universe.
		</text>
		<text> 

We realize again: In addition to being the
cause, The Lord is also the effect of creation with its variety of entities
that have various names and classifications.
		</text>
		<text> The Lord is present as the
Ultimate Self inside everything.
		</text>
		<text> The word 'effect' just means that a different
state of being is attained.
		</text>
		<text>

Those who vouch for the Lord as being
'without form and without qualities' mean that the Lord is devoid of any
limiting qualities.
		</text>
		<text>

[ChAndOgya,
daharavidyA],
8-1-5 describes that the following qualities are
present in a small space inside our hearts: First, it is stated that this space
is without limitations: Without flaws, without ageing, without death, without
sorrow, without hunger, without thirst.
		</text>
		<text> The Lord is present in this space.
		</text>
		<text> His
auspicious qualities are described: He has everything He wished; His every will
is realized.
		</text>
		<text>

The Lord is without limitations.
		</text>
		<text> The word 'qualities' often refers to our limitations.
		</text>
		<text> Hence
the statement is made in some scriptures that 'The Lord is without qualities'.
		</text>
		<text>

Certain scriptures describe the Lord as
having a form of pure knowledge.
		</text>
		<text> They refer to the form of the Lord, who knows
everything and is all-powerful, as being represented by pure knowledge that
shines forth by its own strength.
		</text>
		<text> The form of the Lord is knowledge; He is
devoid of limitations and has all auspicious qualities.
		</text>
		<text>

As said in [muNDaka], 1-1-9:

He knows the broad expanse of knowledge and
has depth in each subject.
		</text>
		<text>

In [shvEtAshvatara], 6-8:

The Lord's ultimate strength is heard in
many different ways.
		</text>
		<text> This strength is natural to Him, so are his knowledge,
power and activities.
		</text>
		<text>

[br'hadArAnyaka], 2-4-14 remarks:

With what should we know the One who is the
knower? This question reflects that we can know the Lord, who knows everything
and is knowledge Himself, only with His grace.
		</text>
		<text>

The statement in [taittarIya], 2-1: [satyam jnAnam anantam
brahma]

'The Lord is the truth, knowledge and is
without an end' - Refers to the Lord in the form of knowledge that shows
itself.
		</text>
		<text> When we are rid of the influence of our deeds, this knowledge shines
forth by itself and we realize the Lord.
		</text>
		<text>

Many scriptures state that the Lord became
the universe with all its beings.
		</text>
		<text> Let's look at them next:

[taittarIya], 2-6 says:
'The Lord wished to become many'.
		</text>
		<text> So also does the [ChAndOgya], 6-2-3: 'The
Lord willed to be many' and the [br'hadArAnyaka], 1-4-7: 'It distinguished
itself into many forms and names'.
		</text>
		<text> All of them state that the Lord Himself is present
in many forms by His own will - this constitutes all of the various states and
forms in which we see things.
		</text>
		<text>

Several scriptures state that nothing
exists without having the Lord at the core of its Self.
		</text>
		<text> The existence of many independent
things is a myth:

[kaThOpanishat], 2-2-10 starts with: 'The person who sees differently over here will go
from one death to another' and goes on to say: [nEha nAnA_sti kinchana] - 'Many different things don't exist here'.
		</text>
		<text>

Similarly, [br'hadArAnyaka], 2-4-14 says: 'The person who believes that there is a second thing
separate from the Lord will see various different things.
		</text>
		<text> The person who
believes that everything has the Lord as the ultimate Self - what does he see,
using what does he see?' 

Meaning, both the eye and the object of
sight have the Lord as their Self.
		</text>
		<text>

Quoting [ChAndOgya], 6-2-3 again:
'It gave rise to many'.
		</text>
		<text>

The Self and the
environment have their own characteristics, while being part of the Lord's
form.
		</text>
		<text>

Scriptures like these state that the many things
we experience are the Lord's form, created by the Lord's will.
		</text>
		<text> Of course, this
does not deny the existence of the Lord in multiple forms, resulting in the experience
of multiple things.
		</text>
		<text> 

Statements like the one in [br'hadArAnyaka], 4-5-15: 'When a person sees everything as his Self' - may seem like they
deny variety.
		</text>
		<text> Yet, their meaning is realized by keeping in mind that everything
is a form of the Lord.
		</text>
		<text> Further reinforcing this, [br'hadArAnyaka], 2-4-6 says: 'All knowledge stands against a person who believes that
there are things that don't have the Lord as the Self'

[subAla], 2
says: All Vedas are just the breath of the great Lord.
		</text>
		<text>

In this way, the scriptures that describe
the distinct forms and characteristics of the Self, the environment and the
Lord do not contradict the other scriptures that hold out the singularity of
cause and effect, describing everything as the Lord Himself.
		</text>
		<text> 

The Self and the environment exist as the body of the Lord always.
		</text>
		<text> They have the
Lord at the core, controlling them.
		</text>
		<text> This holds good in the subtle form in which
they were present before creation - when they could not be distinguished by
form and name.
		</text>
		<text> It also holds in their explicit form after creation, when they
can be distinguished by names.
		</text>
		<text> This is known from all scriptures.
		</text>
		<text> 

If we take the scriptures stating the
singularity of the Lord literally, then the Self would itself be the Lord, then
the Lord would have ignorance.
		</text>
		<text> This goes against all knowledge in the
scriptures.
		</text>
		<text> There is no scope of maintaining this kind of singularity.
		</text>
		<text>

This was a very elaborate and sufficient
discussion of the subject.
		</text>
		<text>

brahmasUtra padai: chaiva
hEtumadbhi: vinishchitai: || 4 ||
		</text>
		<text>

]

[pr'thak] The
fact the body and the Self are distinct [bahudhA gItam] has been told in many ways- [r'Shibhi:] by many Rishis, [vividhai: ChandObhi:] by various Vedas, [brahmasUtra padai:] by the verses of the Brahmasutra.
		</text>
		<text> [vinishchitai:] They state this fact with full conviction, [hEtumadbhi:] along with the reasoning and logic that goes with it.
		</text>
		<text>



The true nature of the body and the Self
has been told by Rishis such as Parashara in many ways.
		</text>
		<text>

Parashara was a great sage who described
the three elements in the Vishnu Purana - the Self, the environment and the
Lord.
		</text>
		<text> In that, he also described the achievement of Moksha.
		</text>
		<text>

There, he explains the three elements
through an anecdote: There was once a king called Bahuguna.
		</text>
		<text> He set out on a
palanquin, normally to be carried by four people.
		</text>
		<text> On that day, only three had
turned up.
		</text>
		<text> Three people couldn't hold it.
		</text>
		<text> Hence, the king called on Jadapradha,
who was standing by the side.
		</text>
		<text> Jadapradha was a sage with vast knowledge, but
looked quite ordinary.
		</text>
		<text> Hence the king mistook him for a commoner.
		</text>
		<text> Jadapradha
lifted the palanquin.
		</text>
		<text> However, due to lack of practice, he did not lift well.
		</text>
		<text> 

The king reprimanded him and Jadapradha
replied - 'When you told me to lift this, did you tell my body or my Self? What
lifted it? The body or the Self? What are you and what am I? Hearing this, the
king realized that the person is no commoner.
		</text>
		<text> He requested Jadapradha to teach
him.
		</text>
		<text> A part of that teaching follows now:

In the [vishNu purANa], 2-13-69,70,71: 'O King! You, I and others have been conceived with the elements.
		</text>
		<text>
All our bodies are bogged down by the flood of three qualities.
		</text>
		<text> These qualities
- sattva, rajas and tamas - are dictated by
the past deeds we committed.
		</text>
		<text> 

The deeds that we commit are born out of
ignorance.
		</text>
		<text> Ignorance is of two types - One is a belief that our body is our
Self; Another is that the Self is independent of the Lord.
		</text>
		<text> This is true of
all beings.
		</text>
		<text> The Self is pure, peaceful and never wears out.
		</text>
		<text> It is not made from
the three qualities, it is superior, beyond
any material'.
		</text>
		<text>

This is continued in [vishNu purANa], 2-13-89,102,103: 'The Self is separate from the body, which is made up of the head
and various other organs.
		</text>
		<text> Given this, what do I address, by the word 'me'? Are
you this head? Or the chest? Or the stomach? Or the collection of legs and
other organs? 

O King, you are distinct from all these
parts of your body.
		</text>
		<text> Think about who you are.
		</text>
		<text> Focus your intelligence on this.
		</text>
		<text>
These two distinct entities - the Self and the environment - both have the Lord as the Ultimate Self'.
		</text>
		<text>

This is also summarized at the end of the
Vishnu Sahasranama: The organs, the mind, the intellect, the elements, energy,
strength, steadfastness - all of them have the Lord as their Ultimate Self - as
does the body and the Self.
		</text>
		<text>

The distinction between the body and the
Self has been told in the other Vedas as well.
		</text>
		<text> 

The origin and nature of the body is
described in [Anandavalli], 1:
'Space came into being from this Ultimate Self; Space carries fields (such
as gravitational and electromagnetic fields); From these fields, energy
came into being; From energy, fluids arose; Fluids became solids and planets.
		</text>
		<text>
From the material of the planets arose organic compounds.
		</text>
		<text> Food in the form of
vegetation is formed out of these compounds.
		</text>
		<text> From this food, the body of a
person comes into being.
		</text>
		<text> Thus, a person is made from food and liquids'.
		</text>
		<text>

The Upanishad described the nature of the
body as being made out of food.
		</text>
		<text> It goes on to state that the body has the
breath of life and is pervaded by a mind.
		</text>
		<text> The Self resides in the body that's
pervaded by the mind.
		</text>
		<text> Yet, it is distinct from the body and the mind.
		</text>
		<text> 

Having described the nature of the Self in
this way, it goes on to say: 'This Self has the Ultimate Self residing in it,
being with infinite knowledge and filled with pure joy'.
		</text>
		<text> 

In this way, the Vedas clearly state the
distinction between the nature of the body and the mind.
		</text>
		<text> They state the fact
that both of them have the Lord at their core.
		</text>
		<text> The Lord is the Ultimate Self.
		</text>
		<text>

The verses of the Brahmasutra describe the
Lord as the owner of the Self and the body.
		</text>
		<text> They do so with conviction and
logic.
		</text>
		<text> They start by establishing that space itself did not exist forever, that
it came into existence at the time of creation.
		</text>
		<text> They go on to describe the
nature of the body - the field of action.
		</text>
		<text>
Then they describe the true form of the Self - the Self always exists in the
form of awareness.
		</text>
		<text>

Finally, they describe the relation between
the Self and the Lord, by saying that the Self is a doer of actions.
		</text>
		<text> That
doership is entirely under the will of the Lord.
		</text>
		<text> The Lord sets the Self into
action - even in this way, the Self has the Lord at its core.
		</text>
		<text> 

The reality of the Self and its field of
action have been elaborated in various scriptures in many ways.
		</text>
		<text> The Lord says -
'Now listen to Me, I will describe it in a clear and brief way'.
		</text>

]

[chEtanA dhr'ti:] The existence of a conscious being [sanghAta:] comes from a combination of the following:

[mahAbhUtAni] The five elements - solids, liquids,
energy, gasses and space;

[ahaMkAra] the universe that existed before them, in which particles formed;

[buddhi:] the state before that, when the singularity expanded;

[avyaktam Eva cha] and the state before that, when the universe was subtle within that
singularity;

[indriyANi dashaikam cha] the ten organs along with the mind;

[pancha cha indriya gOcharA:] and the five stimuli of the organs; 

[ichChA] the desire to have what we like; 

[dvESha:] the desire to avoid what we hate; 

[sukham] comfort; [du:kham]
pain.
		</text>
		<text>

[Etat kShEtram] This field of action -
your body - [udAhr'tam] has just
been described [samAsEna] in summary,
[savikAram] along with the
changes it undergoes.
		</text>
		<text>



The origin of the body has been
explained in this Shloka by quoting the stages in cosmic inflation: Cosmic inflation is the expansion of the subtle singularity,
which existed before creation.
		</text>
		<text> Here, the subtle singularity is called [avyaktam].
		</text>
		<text> The next states are [buddhi] (also called [mahat]), the plasma that resulted from the
inflation, [ahaMkAra]
the state in which subatomic particles were formed, [tanmAtra] the atoms and [mahabhUta], the five elements.
		</text>
		<text>

The body is a
collection of elements formed since the birth of the universe

This Shloka begins with: 'The five
elements; prior to those, the sub-atomic particles; before that, the state of
expansion; before creation, the universe in subtle form'.
		</text>
		<text> This list described
the ingredients involved in the origin of the body.
		</text>
		<text> The body is made from the
five elements - solids, liquids, energy, gasses and space.
		</text>
		<text> These five elements
originated from the particles that were formed during creation.
		</text>
		<text> These particles
resulted from the state of expansion, also termed as cosmic inflation.
		</text>
		<text> 

Before the
state of expansion, all of this existed in a subtle form, incapable of being
distinguished with names.
		</text>
		<text> That is the 'subtle singularity'.
		</text>
		<text>

The 'ten organs with the mind and the five
stimuli' are the entities that have the body as their home.
		</text>
		<text> Our ears, nose,
eyes, tongue and skin are the five sense organs.
		</text>
		<text> Speech, hands, legs and the
two excretory organs are the organs of action.
		</text>
		<text> The mind has the body as its
home too, as do the five stimuli of the senses - sound, touch, form, taste and
smell.
		</text>
		<text>

Feelings of desire, hatred, comfort and
sorrow are associated with the body.
		</text>
		<text> Hence, they are considered to be
variations in the state of the body.
		</text>
		<text>

To clarify: Though desire, hatred, comfort,
sorrow are experienced by the Self, those experiences come out of its
association with the body.
		</text>
		<text> Since these experiences are effects of the body,
they are considered as different states of the body.
		</text>
		<text> This is stated later in
this chapter, Chap.13#20: 'The Self experiences comfort
and sorrow by virtue of being associated with the body'.
		</text>
		<text> 

A combination of all these elements
constitutes the body, which exists as a base on which the Self can experience
feelings such as comfort and sorrow.
		</text>
		<text> The body is the base for worldly
experience as well as the achievement of Moksha.
		</text>
		<text> That is
why this Shloka states that 'The body supports the existence a conscious
being'.
		</text>
		<text>

In this way, the field of action - our body - started with
the environment in the subtle singularity and
ended up in this world.
		</text>
		<text> It is made out of the five elements, contains the
organs and undergoes change due to love, hatred, comfort or pain.
		</text>
		<text> It is a
combination of all these entities, existing as a base for the conscious Self to
have its experiences.
		</text>
		<text> This is our body in brief, along with its various states.
		</text>
		<text>

Next, the Lord describes the virtues that go
with Self-awareness.
		</text>
		<text> These virtues are present in the activities of our body.
		</text>
		<text>

When we recognize the
body for what it is, we live the life we're meant to live

AchArya upAsanam shaucham sthairyam

]

[amAnitvam]
Without a sense of superiority, [adambhitvam] without hypocrisy, [ahiMsA] with no intention to harm anyone, [kShAnti:] being without agitation [Arjavam] with consistency in thought, speech and deed, [AchArya upAsanam] with respect and
adoration for the teacher, [shaucham] with cleanliness, [sthairyam] being steadfast, [Atma vinigraham] with self-discipline.
		</text>
		<text>



Let's now
examine each of the virtues mentioned in this Shloka, which go with Self-realization.
		</text>
		<text>

Being 'without a sense of superiority' is
about being without disrespect towards great people; 

Being 'without hypocrisy' - hypocrisy is
when the path of duty is followed for the sake of gaining fame.
		</text>
		<text> This is about
being free from the goal of achieving fame; 

Having no intention to harm anyone, either
through speech, deeds or thought; 

'Being without agitation' is about having
an unchanged attitude towards those who trouble and provoke; 

'Consistency in thought, speech and deed' -
saying what we intend, doing what we say; 

'Respect and adoration towards the teacher'
is about committing to respect, inquire and serve a teacher who bestows Self-awareness;

'Cleanliness' is the awareness of the Self
- keeping the body, mind and speech fit to achieve that awareness; 

Being 'steadfast' in the quest for the
knowledge of the Self; 

'Self-discipline' is to restrain the organs
from subjects that are opposed to the awareness of the Self.

[vairAgyam]
Without indulging the desire [indriyArthEShu] for the enjoyment of our organs, [anahaMkAra] without the misconception that the body is the Self, [anudarshanam] considering [du:kha dOSha] that flaws and sorrows [janma mr'tyu jarA vyAdhi] such as birth,
death, old age and disease are inevitable consequences of the body.
		</text>
		<text>



Considering that the enjoyment of our
organs is unrelated to the realization of the Self; that it is tainted with
flaws, staying away from them; 

Without the misconception that the body is
the Self - not only the body, this applies to any other entity that can be
confused with the Self; 

Events that cause sorrow - such as death
and disease - are inevitable as long as we are associated with our body.

[asakti:] Not
bound by attachments, [anabhiShvanga:] being without possessiveness [putra dAra
gr'hAdiShu] towards a son, wife or a home, [sama chittatvam] having the same attitude [nityam] at all times, [cha] even on [upapattiShu] encountering [iShTa aniShTa] the favorable and the unfavorable.
		</text>
		<text>



Not bound by attachment to anything other
than the Self; 

Fulfilling the duties towards a son, wife
or home, without stepping over to become possessive about them; 

Having the same attitude at all times, even
on encountering the favorable and the unfavorable - Often we intend something,
after which favorable or unfavorable events happen.
		</text>
		<text>
This is about being without ecstasy or agony in those situations.
		</text>
		<text>

This comes from the fact that the intent is
ours and the outcome is a result of our past deeds.

]

[nityatvam] Being
persistent [adhyAtma jnAna] in
the quest of Self-awareness; [chintanam] Reflection [tatva jnAnArtha] to realize the truth - [Etat] This [jnAnam iti prOktam] is said to be awareness.
		</text>
		<text> [yat] Anything [ata: anyathA] other than this [ajnAnam] is ignorance.
		</text>
		<text>



Having the virtue of persistence in the
quest of the Self; 

The character of 'reflection to realize the
truth' is about dedication towards those thoughts, whose purpose is to know the
true nature of everything - Such awareness leads to the discovery of the Self.
		</text>
		<text> 

The Lord described a set of virtues
starting with Chap.13#7.
		</text>
		<text> He began with the statement 'being without a sense of superiority'.
		</text>
		<text> Such
virtues are useful to everybody in the quest for Self-awareness.
		</text>
		<text> 

What obstacles
come in the way of our lives?

Any work that doesn't comply with these
virtues is called ignorance (for example, work done for fame and superiority,
or due to attachments) - it blocks Self-awareness.
		</text>
		<text>

In the first Shloka of this chapter, the
Lord described the Self as 'the one who is aware'.
		</text>
		<text> Next, He clarifies the nature
of the Self along with its awareness.
		</text>
		<text>

[pravakShyAmi]
I will explain [tat yat jnEyam]
that awareness, [jnAtvA yat] with
which [amr'tam ashnutE] people
achieve freedom from the cycle of death.
		</text>
		<text> [brahma] The Self expands [mat param] to realize that I am supreme.
		</text>
		<text> [na sat] This state is not the one in which
the Self is bound to this environment.
		</text>
		<text> [na asat
uchyatE] It is also not the state when the Self is
present in the subtle singularity.
		</text>
		<text>



The Lord continues - 

The Self is always evident to us.
		</text>
		<text> Its
nature must be grasped by the virtues described
before in Chap.13#7.
		</text>
		<text> 

I will clarify the nature of the Self now.
		</text>
		<text>
You will grasp the Self with this knowledge.
		</text>
		<text> 

By nature, the Self is not subject to the
laws of the material world.
		</text>
		<text> It is free of birth, old age and death.
		</text>
		<text> It has no
beginning, likewise no ending either.
		</text>
		<text> This is said in [kaTha upanishat], 2-18: 'It is not born, does not perish, it is full of wisdom'.
		</text>
		<text> 

The Self realizes My supremacy, as I said
in Chap.7#5: 'Know My ultimate nature in the form of a conscious being, by whom
this world is sustained'

By being the body
of the Lord, It is in the very nature of the Self to enjoy being under the
service of the Lord.
		</text>
		<text> This is said in the [br'hadArAnyaka], 3-7-22: 'The One who is situated in the Self and pervades it; The One whom
the Self does not know; The One whose body is
the Self; The One who controls the Self from its core'.
		</text>
		<text>

And in [shvEtAshvatara], 6-9: He is the Controller of the one who controls the organs.
		</text>
		<text> He has no
origin, He has no controller.
		</text>
		<text> In [shvEtAshvatara], 9-16: He is the owner of both
the Self and the environment; The Lord of all qualities.
		</text>
		<text>

The knowledge in the Self is infinite.
		</text>
		<text> It
is distinct from the body and not bound by it.
		</text>
		<text> As said in [shvEtAshvatara], 5-9: The Self is able to achieve the state of boundlessness.
		</text>
		<text> Being
bound to a body is the outcome of the actions committed by the Self.
		</text>
		<text> When the
Self is free from the bonds of action, it reaches infinity.
		</text>
		<text>


The word [brahma] in this chapter refers to the unbound Self.
		</text>
		<text> The word [brahma] is used this way in other Shlokas
too - as in Chap.14#26: 'With focused devotion, a person completely overcomes
the three qualities and is cut out to [brahmabhUya] - the experience the Self in its true form' and in Chap.18#54:
'Having realized the Self, with a serene mind, he doesn't get upset and doesn't
yearn.
		</text>
		<text> Such a person realizes the equivalence among all beings.
		</text>
		<text> He attains
ultimate devotion to Me'.
		</text>
		<text>

The last part of this Shloka says - 'This
state is not the one in which the Self is bound to this environment.
		</text>
		<text> It is also
not the state when the Self is present in the subtle
singularity'.
		</text>
		<text> 

When liberated, the
Self is not associated with being the cause, nor the effect.
		</text>
		<text> The words 'cause'
and 'effect' don't relate to the state of the Self.
		</text>
		<text> While interpreting this
Shloka, the word '[sat]' is
mapped to the state after creation, where things can be distinguished and be
named.
		</text>
		<text> '[asat]' is the state
before creation, when this could not be done.
		</text>
		<text> 

This interpretation is supported by the
scriptures:

[Anandavalli], 7:
'[asat] was the state that
existed before all this.
		</text>
		<text> Then [sat] was born' and [br'hadArAnyaka], 1-4-7: 'At that time (before
creation), this world was undivided.
		</text>
		<text> The Lord created the classifications with
names and forms'

Ignorance prevents the
Self from expressing its completeness

The terms 'cause' and 'effect' are
applicable to the ignorance that sticks to the Self, by the influence of past
actions.
		</text>
		<text> They are not characteristic of the Self.
		</text>
		<text> Hence, these terms don't
describe the nature of the Self.
		</text>
		<text>

The phrase '[asat] was the state that existed before all this' says that the universe
and its beings were the body of the Lord
before creation, though in subtle form.
		</text>
		<text> 

Before creation, the Lord had His body (the
universe) in subtle form.
		</text>
		<text> That was a state in which nothing could be
distinguished by a name.
		</text>
		<text> Even in this state, the Self is still bound to the
material world due to its actions.
		</text>
		<text> That does not describe its true nature.
		</text>
		<text>

[tat] It [sarvata: pANi pAdam] has all possible arms
and feet, [sarvata: akShi shirO mukham] all possible eyes, heads and faces [sarvata:
shrutimat] and all possible activities.
		</text>
		<text> [tiShThati] It is [sarvam
Avr'tya] all-pervasive [lOkE] in this world.
		</text>
		<text>



The pure and liberated
Self is capable of doing anything that can be done by our organs.
		</text>
		<text> It has eyes,
heads and faces everywhere.
		</text>
		<text> It accomplishes all activities of these organs.
		</text>
		<text> 

In the scriptures, [svEtAshvatara] 3-19 describes the Lord in this way: 'He moves about without using any
legs, grasps without hands, sees without eyes, listens without ears'.
		</text>
		<text> It means
the Lord can accomplish anything we do with our organs, while not being bound
by them.
		</text>
		<text> 

When liberated, the
pure Self is equivalent to the Lord.
		</text>
		<text> It can accomplish the same without needing
any organs.
		</text>
		<text> 

The equivalence is mentioned in the
scriptures, as in [muMDaka upanishat], 3-1-3: 'The one who practices
devotion gives up both virtue and flaw, becomes pure, achieving equality with
the Ultimate'.
		</text>
		<text> It is also said in Chap.14#2: 'Having gained this knowledge,
they achieve My characteristics'.
		</text>
		<text>

This Shloka ended with: 'It is all-pervasive
in this world' - It pervades every entity that exists in this world.
		</text>
		<text> In its
pure form, the Self does not have constraints of space.
		</text>
		<text> Hence it pervades
everything.

		<text> [nirguNam] It is free of the three qualities,

The Self is the one which illuminates all
organs - these organs sense, act and are involved in an experience, only if a
Self is associated with them.
		</text>
		<text> 

The Self is capable of knowing even without
the organs.
		</text>
		<text> When freed from the boundaries of the organs,
the Self naturally knows everything.
		</text>
		<text> 

By nature, the Self is not attached to any
body - not also the body of a powerful god.
		</text>
		<text>
Yet, the Self is capable of donning any body, as said in [ChAndOgya], 7-16-2: 'When the Self is liberated, it can take one form, three forms.
		</text>
		<text>.
		</text>
		<text>.
		</text>

The pure Self is naturally free of the three qualities.

the effects of those qualities.

In its liberated
state, the Self is rid of the elements - being free from all forms of solids,
liquids, gasses, energy and space, the Self has no body.
		</text>
		<text> It is then outside of
all bodies.
		</text>
		<text> It can choose to be inside any body it wishes, as said in [ChandOgya], 8-12-3: 'it plays and enjoys, passing time with friends'.
		</text>
		<text>

By nature, it isn't bound by space and time
- it is unmoved.
		</text>
		<text> When it owns a body, it moves about.
		</text>
		<text>

We do not recognize the Self, even though it
is present in our body.
		</text>
		<text> That's because it is extremely subtle.
		</text>
		<text> Though it is endowed
with every capability and all knowledge, those who are bound to this world do
not recognize it as being distinct from their bodies.
		</text>
		<text> 

This Shloka ends by saying: 'Even while
being far away, the Self is close by'.
		</text>
		<text> 

The Self seems a far reach to those who aren't
capable of the virtues described before
(Chap.13#7-11).

		<text> For example, someone with a sense of superiority is far from
realizing the Self, even though it is present in their own body.
		</text>
		<text> 

Those with the virtues described in the
same shlokas (Chap.13#7-11), like those  without a
sense of superiority would find the Self close by, right within their grasp.

]

[tat] The Self,
[jnEyam] which is to be recognized,
[sthitam] is present [bhUtEShu] in all beings [avibhaktam] without variation.
		</text>
		<text> [cha] Yet, [vibhaktam
iva] it seems like the Self in each being is varied in
nature.
		</text>
		<text> [bhUta bhartr'] It
wears the form of the being it owns.
		</text>
		<text> [gr'siShNu] It is the one that absorbs [prabhaviShNu
cha] and the one that thrives.
		</text>
		<text>



The Self is pure
knowledge

The Self is identical in all beings, in the
form of pure knowledge.
		</text>
		<text> To the ignorant, it seems to vary based on the form of
the being - some beings have a powerful form, some don't and so on.
		</text>
		<text> 

Usually, the Self is equated to the body,
when we say 'I am powerful', 'I am ordinary' and so on.
		</text>
		<text> Yet, it is distinct
from the body - it is capable of awareness, while the body isn't.
		</text>
		<text>

It is possible to know the Self, as
mentioned at the beginning of this chapter (Chap.13#2).
		</text>
		<text> It is possible to know
the Self as being distinct from the variety of bodies it occupies - this is
expressed here by the phrase 'It wears the form of the being it owns'.
		</text>
		<text> 

We must realize that the one who wears the
body - the Self - is distinct from the body itself.
		</text>
		<text> The body is formed by
bringing the elements of nature together.
		</text>
		<text> It is possible to know that the wearer
of the body is distinct from the body which is worn.
		</text>
		<text> 

This is illustrated in the Shloka with an
example: Our body absorbs nature.
		</text>
		<text> We eat things made from the elements of
nature, such as rice.
		</text>
		<text> It is possible to know ourselves as those who eat,
distinct from the food being eaten.
		</text>
		<text> 

The Self in our body causes the
transformation of food.
		</text>
		<text> The food we eat transforms into tissues, blood and
other parts of the body, producing the experience of thriving growth and
sustenance.
		</text>
		<text> 

The Self is distinct from that food, before
and after this transformation.
		</text>
		<text> This is evident by the fact that a dead body
does not transform food into anything.
		</text>
		<text> So, the combination of elements that
form the body cannot be the cause of this transformation.
		</text>

The Self is what makes the experience of brightness happen.

The word [tamas] used in this Shloka refers to the inanimate environment in its
subtle state before creation.

		<text> The environment doesn't have the capability to
know and experience.

		<text> 

The Self is beyond the bounds of this
environment.
		</text>
		<text>

The Self itself is awareness.
		</text>
		<text> We must
recognize it.
		</text>
		<text> The Self can be grasped by practicing the virtues that were
described in Chap.13#7-11, such as being without a
sense of superiority.
		</text>
		<text> 

The Self is specially embedded at the heart
of all beings.

In this way, the entity we call 'our body'
was described briefly in Chap.13#5,6.
		</text>
		<text> 

After this, the achievement of
Self-awareness was described starting from Chap.13#7 up
until Chap.13#11.
		</text>
		<text> 

The true nature of the Self was described
in brief, starting with Chap.13#12 and concluding with Chap.13#17.
		</text>
		<text> The Self was described as the one that must be recognized.
		</text>
		<text>


After this, the Lord says - 'Knowing these
- the body, the Self being distinct from the body and the means to grasp the
true form of the Self - My devotee steps up to achieve equality with Me.
		</text>
		<text> He
steps up to achieve My characteristics, being independent of the material world.
		</text>
		<text>
This is his natural state'.
		</text>
		<text>

The material environment and the Self have
vastly different characteristics.

bond between them, how they work in bondage and the reason for their bonding.

The states we traverse - such as the states
of desire and hatred - bind us to the environment.
		</text>
		<text>  Virtues such as being without a sense of superiority lead to
freedom.

Both of them - the states that bind us and
the virtues that free us - are born out of an
association with the body and the environment.

The body is made up of the elements of the

		<text> When it is associated with the Self, it goes through various
states such as desire and hatred.
		</text>
		<text> This causes the Self to get entangled.

[prakr'ti:] The
material environment [hEtu: uchyatE] is said to be the cause [kArya kAraNa
kartr'tvE] of the transactions in the body, the organs
and the mind.
		</text>
		<text> [puruSha:] The
Self [hEtu: uchyatE] is said to
be the space [sukha du:khAnAm bhOktr'tvE] in which happiness and sorrow are experienced.
		</text>
		<text>



The sense organs, organs of action and the
mind constitute the body.
		</text>
		<text> The body is made up of elements
of the environment.
		</text>
		<text> When the Self occupies a body, its organs become active.
		</text>
		<text>
These activities lead to experiences that keep happening, as long as the Self is
in the body.
		</text>
		<text> 

The role of the Self is to preside over the
body and sustain it.
		</text>
		<text> In support of that fact, the Brahmasutra says: [kartA shAstrArthavatvAt] -
the Self initiates action.
		</text>
		<text> That's why the scriptures address the Self when they
preach virtues such as humility, honesty and devotion.
		</text>
		<text> 

The intention to do something
and initiate action is left to the Self.
		</text>
		<text> Everything else goes according to the
Lord's will.
		</text>
		<text> 

In summary:

The Self presides over the body and
sustains it, bringing initiative - that's it.
		</text>
		<text> Experiences such as comfort and
pain come from its association with the material world.
		</text>
		<text> In other words, our
body is the field in which comfort and pain are experienced by the Self.
		</text>
		<text>

In this way, the division of work between
the environment (the body) and the Self was described.
		</text>
		<text> It holds as long as the
Self and the body are bound together.
		</text>
		<text> 

Next, the reason for the Self to be bound
in material experiences is described.

		<text> Why we are bound this way, even though
the Self is pure joy and experiences itself?

This Shloka talks about 'the qualities born
out of the environment'.
		</text>
		<text> 

These are the effects of the three qualities - sattva results in
serenity and knowledge, rajas leads to the 'drive' that comes from
desire and hatred, tamas leads to lethargy.
		</text>

The natural state of the Self is to
experience itself in the form of perpetual pure joy.

		<text>

]

[kAraNam] This
is caused by [guNasanga: asya]
its association with the three qualities [janmasu] in births [yOni] originating from [sat] virtue [asat] and
flaws.
		</text>
		<text>



In the past, this Self has been in various
environments and bodies as a result of different births - being born as a
powerful being, as an ordinary human, as an animal or a lower life form.
		</text>
		<text> 

It has pursued desires, comforts and
sorrows according to those births.
		</text>
		<text> These pursuits were driven by the three qualities.
		</text>
		<text> In these endeavors, actions of
virtue were committed, along with flaws and mistakes.
		</text>
		<text> 

To experience the outcomes of those
actions, the Self takes on pleasant or unpleasant births again.
		</text>
		<text> It takes initiatives
in accordance with its birth.
		</text>
		<text> Again, it is born to experience the outcomes of
those initiatives.
		</text>
		<text>

It keeps cycling in the material world, till
the time it cultivates virtues that lead to Self-awareness.
		</text>
		<text>
Virtues such as humility lead to
Self-awareness (described in Chap.13#7-11).
		</text>
		<text> 

In this way, the Self is bound to the
material world.
		</text>
		<text> It happens due to its association with the three qualities over many births.
		</text>
		<text> This
association is born out of virtues and flaws committed during those previous
births.

		<text> [paramAtmA iti cha api

		</text>
		<text>



The Self plays the role of a witness and enabler while it's in a body- with its intentions
and initiatives that suit the body it occupies.
		</text>
		<text> In this way the Self holds the
body together.
		</text>
		<text> 

It also experiences the feelings of comfort
and sorrow that are generated by the tendencies of the body.
		</text>
		<text> In this way, the
Self is the owner of the body, its organs and the mind.
		</text>
		<text> It coordinates activities
by sustaining the body and by being its controller.
		</text>
		<text> 

A similar fact is stated later in
Chap.15#8: 'When the lord of the body takes leave of its environment (when it
leaves the body at the time of death), it takes the essence of the body along,
just as the wind takes the fragrance from a fragrant thing'.
		</text>
		<text>

The Self is also said to be the supreme
person in relation to the body, its organs and the mind.
		</text>
		<text> The Self in relation
to the body and the mind is described next in Chap.13#24: 'Some see the Self
inside their body through focused thought, using their mind'.
		</text>
		<text>

Notice the phrase [cha api] - 'also' in
this Shloka ('It is also said to be the supreme person').
		</text>
		<text> It implies that the
Self is regarded as the supreme person, in addition to being the controller.
		</text>
		<text>
The superiority of the Self is described in Chap.13#12: 'The Self expands to
infinite knowledge, realizing that the Lord is supreme'.
		</text>
		<text>

The Self has been
entangled since beginning-less time

The Self has unbroken knowledge and
strength.
		</text>
		<text> However, it has been bound to the environment from beginning-less
time.
		</text>
		<text> Due to this, it is attached to the three
qualities and is the controller of this body, nothing more.

be supreme only in relation to the body.

[pashyan]
Seeing [Ishvaram] the owner of
the body, [samavasthitam]
situated at the core of [sarvatra] every being [samam]
in the same way, [na hinasti]
he does not torture [AtmAnam]
the Self [AtmanA] with his
mind.
		</text>
		<text> [tata:] That's why [yAnti hi] he will certainly reach [parAm gatim] the ultimate
goal.
		</text>
		<text>



In every being - whether animal, an
ordinary human or a powerful person - a Self is present as its owner, forming
the basis for the existence of the being.
		</text>
		<text> 

A person who sees the Self in everyone as
equal - having unbounded awareness as its only true form, irrespective of the
kind of body it owns - such a person does not torture the Self in himself with
the mind.
		</text>
		<text> Meaning, he frees the Self from this material
world, using his mind.
		</text>
		<text>

In this way, by seeing the Self as pure awareness,
being equal in all, he realizes the true nature of the Self and reaches the ultimate goal.
		</text>
		<text> 

On the other hand, a person who sees the
Self as being different because it's associated with different beings will
throw his Self into the depths of the material world.
		</text>
		<text> In this way he tortures
himself.

[cha] Further, [ya: pashyati] the person who sees that [karmANi] activities [kriyamANAni] that are carried out [sarvasha: prakr'tyA Eva] come strictly from
the environment [tathA] will
infer that [AtmAnam] the Self [akartAram] does not carry out actions.
		</text>
		<text> [sa: pashyati] Such a person sees the Self
in its true form.
		</text>
		<text>



Universally, all activities carried out are
a result of happenings in the environment,
soaked in its three qualities.
		</text>
		<text> This was said
already in Chap.13#20: 'The material environment is said to be the cause of the
transactions of the body, the organs and the mind'.
		</text>
		<text>

The person who sees that all activities are
a result of the body and the environment will see the Self as pure awareness.
		</text>
		<text>
He doesn't see it as the one who carries out the work.
		</text>
		<text> Such a person is aware
of the Self and sees it in true form.
		</text>
		<text>

This person knows that his ignorance comes
out of past deeds.
		</text>
		<text> He also knows this ignorance to be responsible for his bond
with the environment, being bound inside a body and in experiences of comfort
and sorrow.
		</text>
		<text>

(If the Self does not carry out actions
as described here, what does it do? Look back at Chap.13#20 for a description
of what the Self does)

[yadA] When [anupashyati] he recognizes that [bhAvam] the intuition [pr'thak] of separate [bhUta] bodies [Ekastham] is actually part of one environment [cha] and sees that [vistAram] the expanse of variety [tata: Eva] comes from the same, [tadA] then, [sampadyatE]
he earns [brahma] the Self.
		</text>

Each being in this world is a combination
of the environment and the Self.
		</text>
		<text> This is true of everyone, from the most
powerful to the least, human or otherwise.
		</text>
		<text> The beings of this world exhibit a wide
variety of character such as powerful and ordinary, big and small.
		</text>
		<text> 

When a person sees all these visible
characteristics as part of a single entity - the environment, when he sees his
succession of children and grandchildren as an effect of that environment
itself, he gains the Self immediately.
		</text>
		<text> He sees the Self as an unbroken expanse
of pure awareness.

[anAditvAt] By
being without a beginning [nirguNatvAt] and without the three qualities, [ayam paramAtmA] this supreme essence [avyaya:] doesn't wear out.
		</text>
		<text> [kauntEya] Arjuna, [sharIrastha:
api] though the Self is situated in the body, [na karOti] it does not make anything happen, [na lipyatE] it doesn't get stuck.
		</text>
		<text>



This Self is the supreme owner of the body
and mind.
		</text>
		<text> It has been described as being separate from the body, with entirely separate
characteristics.
		</text>
		<text> 

Even though the Self is inside the body, it
does not wear out and perish.
		</text>
		<text> To start with, it has no beginning.
		</text>
		<text> It does not
have the three qualities in its nature; hence
it does not make anything happen in the
environment.
		</text>
		<text> 

The Self isn't affected by anything that
happens in the body or the rest of the environment - those happenings do not
stick to the Self or alter its characteristics.
		</text>
		<text>

The question now is- 'This Shloka states
that the Self does not make anything happen, since it isn't made up of the three qualities.
		</text>
		<text> Yet, it is constantly associated
with the environment and a body.
		</text>
		<text> Still, the characteristics of the body don't
stick to it.
		</text>
		<text> How come?'

This question is answered next.

[yatha] Just as
[AkAsham] space [sarvagatam] pervades all matter, [na upalipyatE] yet remains without getting
attached to anything [saukShmyAt] by virtue of being subtle - [tathA] so also [AtmA] the
Self [sarvatra avasthita:] is
constantly present [dEhE] in
every body, [na upalipyatE] yet
doesn't get attached to any of their characteristics.
		</text>
		<text>



Every single object has space, no matter
how small it is.
		</text>
		<text> Though space is associated with every object, it doesn't get
attached to the characteristics of any object.
		</text>
		<text> Space is subtle.
		</text>
		<text>

(This is easily seen - even when a
region of space is occupied by a very dirty object, there no dirt sticking to that
space.
		</text>
		<text> When the object completely vacates it, that space remains unaffected)

Though the Self pervades
the body, it doesn't have any characteristics of the body

Similarly, the Self is extremely subtle.
		</text>
		<text> It
doesn't get stuck with any characteristics of the body, though it has occupied
all kinds of bodies - powerful, ordinary, big and small.

Arjuna, [yathA] just as [Eka:] a single [sUrya:] sun [prakAshayati]
spreads light [kr'tsnam imam lOkam] on this entire earth, [tathA] so also [kShEtrI]
the owner of the body [prakAshayati] lights up [kr'tsnam kShEtram] the entire body.
		</text>
		<text>



Just as a single Sun lights up this entire
solar system with its brightness, the owner of the body - the Self - lights up
all external and internal organs of the body with consciousness.
		</text>
		<text> 

The Self is conscious.
		</text>
		<text> It knows - 'I exist
in this body; this body is mine'.
		</text>
		<text> Its consciousness reaches out everywhere
right from the feet to the head.
		</text>
		<text>

The bright Sun is distinct from the rest of
the solar system, which is lit by the Sun.
		</text>
		<text> In the same way, the Self is
distinct from the body.
		</text>
		<text> The qualities of the Self as the knower were described.

This chapter described the distinction
between the body as the field of action
and the Self as the knower of this field.
		</text>
		<text>
Their distinct characteristics are realized by people with eyes of awareness.
		</text>
		<text> 

In addition, those who learn about freedom
from the material world will attain the supreme - they achieve the Self, which
is free of all bonds.
		</text>
		<text> This freedom is Moksha.
		</text>
		<text> 

The virtues described in this chapter, such
as being without a sense of superiority, lead
to Moksha.
		</text>
		<text> 

The awareness about the distinctions
between the Self and the body was laid out in this chapter.
		</text>
		<text> 

In summary, the body is a part of the
environment.
		</text>
		<text> It is our field of action, a result of the elements.
		</text>
		<text> 

The knowledge to discriminate between the
Self and the body, along with the virtues required
to achieve freedom from the bonds of the environment were laid out in this
chapter - starting with being without a sense of
superiority.
		</text>
		<text>

With this ability to discriminate the body
and the Self, people learn and practice the method
to get freedom from the environment.
		</text>
		<text> They achieve the Self in its true form -
free of all limitations, an unbroken expanse of knowledge.

		<text>Chapter 14

In the 13th chapter, the characteristics of
the Self and the environment were described, along with their association.
		</text>
		<text> Then,
several virtues were listed, such as being
without a sense of superiority.
		</text>
		<text> These virtues help in realizing the Self.
		</text>
		<text> 

With these virtues, devotion
and the Lord's compassion, a person is freed from
material bonds.
		</text>
		<text> 

The cause of the bond with the material
world was also stated - the bond is due to our desires, such as our craving for
happiness.
		</text>
		<text> The three qualities soak the
desires of the material world with their influence.
		</text>
		<text> This was told in
Chap.13#21: 'The Self is bound to the environment due to its association with
the three qualities in births that came from
virtue and flaws'.
		</text>
		<text>

Next, in this chapter, the Lord describes
the way in which these three qualities bind
us, along with the method to gain freedom from these qualities.

Each and every being that isn't free is

with a Self.

[bhArata]
Arjuna, [brahma] the universe [mama yOni:] it is My womb.
		</text>
		<text> [mahat] It is a manifestation of the plasma
that resulted from cosmic inflation.
		</text>
		<text> [tasmin] In that, [aham
dadhAmi] I bring together [garbham] life that can reproduce.
		</text>
		<text> [tata:] Then, [sambhava:]
the creation [sarva bhUtAnAm]
of all beings [bhavati]
happens.
		</text>
		<text>



My universe is the origin from which everything
came into being.
		</text>
		<text> That is My womb.
		</text>
		<text> In that, I infuse consciousness and give
birth.
		</text>
		<text> The Lord described this in Chap.7#4 by explaining His material
attribute: 'This universe of mine is divided into eight categories: Solids,
liquids, gasses, energy, space, mind, the gross collections and the notion of
individuality.
		</text>
		<text>'

Before creation, the Lord's inanimate
matter exists as the subtle singularity.
		</text>
		<text> At
the time of creation, it changes into plasma, then into the state in which
subatomic particles were formed, then the atoms and then the five elements of
Solids, liquids, gasses, energy and space.
		</text>
		<text>

Since it expands into this huge universe,
it's called as [mahat brahma],
the one which becomes huge.
		</text>
		<text>

It is not common to use the word [brahma] to refer to the universe.
		</text>
		<text> The word [brahma] means something that's expansive.
		</text>
		<text>
Though it is commonly used to describe the principal architect of the universe,
it is also used in several places to mean the universe itself.
		</text>
		<text> This is illustrated
next.
		</text>
		<text>

In the scriptures, the universe has been
referred to by the word [brahma], as in [muMDaka, 1-1-9]: 'This material world gets
created, becomes recognizable and gets ready to be experienced.
		</text>
		<text> This material
world, known as 'brahma' comes from the One who is aware of everything, has
full depth of understanding and whose endeavors are full of awareness'.
		</text>
		<text> 

The inanimate matter in the material world
is one attribute of the Lord.
		</text>
		<text> The conscious Self is the other.
		</text>
		<text> 

The Self is described to be beyond the material
environment in Chap.7#5: 'My ultimate nature is distinct from the universe.
		</text>
		<text> It
is in the form of a conscious being by whom this world is sustained'.
		</text>
		<text> This
supreme attribute of the Lord has been described as the set of all that's
conscious.
		</text>
		<text> 

The conscious Self, when infused in the
environment, acts as the seed to create all beings.
		</text>
		<text> This is how these beings
are created in the womb.
		</text>
		<text> 

The Lord continues - 'In the huge universe,
which is My inanimate womb, I give birth - I bring together this environment
and the collection of consciousness.
		</text>
		<text>

The inanimate environment is experienced;
The Self is the one who experiences - this attribute of Mine brings
consciousness to the world.
		</text>
		<text> I bring the Self and its environment together.
		</text>
		<text> 

Then, all beings, right from the principal
engineer of the universe down to a germ, come into being from My two attributes
- the environment and the Self.
		</text>
		<text> They are joined by My will'.
		</text>
		<text>

Next, the Lord says that even after creating
this universe, He continues to bring together His inanimate and conscious
attributes in each being that is born.

		</text>
		<text> [aham bIjaprada: pitA] I am the father who
infuses life in the embryo.
		</text>
		<text> 



All beings in this universe have their
origin in the material of the cosmic inflation.
		</text>
		<text>

That includes all humans - powerful,
ordinary, handsome, ugly, cruel, kind, along with all animals, birds, plants
and so on.
		</text>
		<text> All of their various forms originated from the plasma that formed
during creation.
		</text>
		<text>

In this Shloka, The Lord says 'I have put
together all conscious beings.
		</text>
		<text> Their bodies are made from the matter in the
environment, which formed from the results of the cosmic inflation.
		</text>
		<text> I am the
One who infuses life in the embryo, during their birth' - The Lord puts
together the Self and the body of all conscious beings in accordance with their
deeds.
		</text>
		<text>

In this way, the Lord explained that
conscious beings get associated with inanimate matter at the start of creation.
		</text>
		<text>
This association happens due to the influence of various deeds they committed
in the past.
		</text>
		<text>

Next, He explains the reason why they
repeatedly take birth in various wombs in different forms.

The three qualities
bind the Self in a body.
		</text>
		<text>

Serenity (sattva),
drive (rajas) and lethargy (tamas)
are the three qualities that go with the
material environment.
		</text>
		<text> In fact, they define the nature of the material environment.
		</text>
		<text>


They are not perceived directly.
		</text>
		<text> They are
perceived only by the effects they bring - The quality of sattva brings
learning, rajas brings desire and hatred, tamas brings
reluctance to act.
		</text>
		<text> 

They don't exist before creation, when the environment is in its subtle
state.
		</text>
		<text> They come into being during cosmic
inflation, when the subtle singularity
changes into a state of plasma, becoming sub-atomic particles that evolve into
the five elements.
		</text>
		<text> Unique combinations of those elements produce human bodies
and other forms.
		</text>
		<text> 

A Self that's bound to the environment is
associated with one of these bodies.
		</text>
		<text> It is the owner of that body.
		</text>
		<text> While the
body changes, the Self never changes or wears out.
		</text>
		<text> By its nature, the Self is
not associated with the three qualities.
		</text>
		<text> Yet it's
tied down by them when it is in the body.
		</text>
		<text>  Its bondage is caused by being
inside a body.

Next, the Lord describes the
characteristics of sattva, rajas and
tamas.

		</text>
		<text> [anAmayam] It has no disease associated with it.

Among the three
qualities of sattva, rajas and tamas, the nature of sattva is to
illuminate by being flawless.
		</text>
		<text> Its flawlessness is in giving the joy of knowing
without obscuring anything.
		</text>
		<text> Its nature is to generate the joy of knowledge
alone - in this way, it is the source of joy.

does not have any effect that can be called as a disease.
		</text>
		<text> It is the source of
well-being.
		</text>
		<text>

This quality called sattva
binds the Self by attaching it to contentment and knowledge.
		</text>
		<text> It is the one that
attaches a person to the comfort of being content and knowledgeable.
		</text>
		<text> As soon as
such attachment is born, a person indulges in the material world to achieve it
by his occupation or by rituals.
		</text>
		<text>

Then, this person is born in a womb, in a
form suited to experience the fruits of his pursuit.
		</text>
		<text> In this way, the quality
of sattva binds the person to experience the joy of
knowledge.
		</text>
		<text> It rewards the joy of knowledge, again binding a person to this
experience and craving for more.
		</text>
		<text> 

This is called sattva.

[viddhi] Know [raja:] rajas to be a
quality that [rAgAtmakam] has
passion at its core.
		</text>
		<text> [tr'ShNA sanga samudbhavam] It is the space where insatiable desires and bonds are born.
		</text>
		<text> [kauntEya] Arjuna, [tat
nibadhnAti] it binds [dEhinam] the Self [karma sangEna] by attaching it to actions.
		</text>
		<text>



The quality called rajas gives rise to passion.
		</text>
		<text> Here, 'passion' is meant as a
bond, like the intimacy between a male and a female.
		</text>
		<text>

It is the space where insatiable desires
and bonds are born.
		</text>
		<text> It brings the thirst to experience material desires, the
'drive' to experience the various things that stimulate our senses.
		</text>
		<text> It makes the
bond with family and friends.
		</text>
		<text>

Rajas is passion.
		</text>
		<text>

With this, the quality of rajas
instigates desires and attachments, binding the Self with actions.
		</text>
		<text> 

The Self initiates some actions, being
driven by these desires and attachments.
		</text>
		<text> These actions constitute virtue and
vice.
		</text>
		<text> They cause rebirth in a form that can experience the results of those
actions.
		</text>
		<text> The Self then takes birth in a womb that can bear this form.
		</text>
		<text> It's
driven to action again - the cycle repeats.
		</text>
		<text> 

In this way, the quality of rajas
binds the Self by using our attachment to actions.
		</text>
		<text>

This rajas is said to
be the source of passion, unquenchable desire and bonding.
		</text>
		<text> It is said to bind
us to actions.

[bhArata]
Arjuna, [viddhi] know [tama: tu] tamas to be
a quality that [ajnAnajam]
gives rise to ignorance [mOhanam] and delusion [sarva dEhinAm] in every Self that owns a body.
		</text>
		<text> [tat
nibadhnAti] It binds the Self [pramAda] with carelessness, [Alasya] lethargy [nidrAbhi:] and drowsiness.
		</text>
		<text>



Tamas
is ignorance and lethargy.
		</text>
		<text>

Ignorance is opposed to awareness.
		</text>
		<text> Being
'aware' is to know all things as they are.
		</text>
		<text> Ignorance tells us otherwise.
		</text>
		<text> 

The quality called tamas
is a misunderstanding of the true nature of things.
		</text>
		<text> It deludes every Self that
owns a body.
		</text>
		<text> 'Delusion' is knowledge that is opposed to reality.
		</text>
		<text> The quality of
tamas causes this flawed knowledge.
		</text>
		<text> 

By being the source of carelessness,
lethargy and drowsiness, tamas ties down the owner of a
body.
		</text>
		<text> 

'Carelessness' is lack of attention, which
causes mistakes in our actions.
		</text>
		<text> 

'Lethargy' is the characteristic of not
starting any activity.
		</text>
		<text> It's a state of being rigid and pretentious.
		</text>
		<text> 

'Drowsiness' happens when our limbs are
tired of activity and start retiring to rest.
		</text>
		<text> In this state, our organs recede
and we sleep.
		</text>
		<text> In addition to this, when the mind is also at rest, it is called
deep sleep.
		</text>
		<text>

Next, the prominent bonds that come from
the three qualities of sattva,
rajas and tamas are summarized.

[bhArata]
Arjuna, [sattvam] the quality
of sattva [sanjayati] binds us [sukhE] in
comfort.
		</text>
		<text> [raja:] The quality of
rajas [karmaNi] binds us in actions.
		</text>
		<text> [tama:] The quality of tamas [jnAnam
Avr'tya] conceals knowledge and [pramAdE sanjayati] binds us in mistakes.
		</text>
		<text>



The primary effect of sattva
is to bind us in comfort.
		</text>
		<text> 

The quality of rajas
predominantly addicts us to activity.
		</text>
		<text> 

On the other hand, the quality of tamas conceals awareness of the true nature of things.
		</text>
		<text> This
gives rise to misconceptions.
		</text>
		<text> In this way, its main effect is to cause
indulgence in work that must not be done, binding us to mistakes and other
faults.
		</text>
		<text>

The three
qualities are accumulated in the form of a body we own.
		</text>
		<text> By their very
nature, they bind us to the material world.
		</text>
		<text> 

All these three
qualities exist all the time.
		</text>
		<text> They generate effects that are opposite to
each other - such as awareness and ignorance.
		</text>
		<text> How do they generate
contradictory effects on the body? This question is answered next.

[bhArata]
Arjuna, [sattvam] the quality
of sattva [bhavati] takes effect [abhibhUya] by overpowering [rajas tama: cha] rajas and tamas.
		</text>
		<text> [raja:] The quality of rajas
[sattvam tama: cha Eva] comes
forth too, by suppressing sattva and tamas.
		</text>
		<text>
[tama:] The quality of tamas [sattvam raja: tathA] suppresses sattva and rajas
in the same way.
		</text>
		<text>



Even while the three
qualities of sattva, rajas and tamas bind every Self with the environment, they expand or
contract due to past actions and due to various foods that are consumed to
nurture the body.
		</text>
		<text> 

Sometimes, the qualities of rajas
and tamas contract.
		</text>
		<text> This makes way for sattva
to take precedence.
		</text>
		<text> Sometimes, rajas predominates by
suppressing sattva and tamas.
		</text>
		<text>
Likewise, sometimes tamas takes effect by suppressing sattva and rajas.
		</text>
		<text>

At any point in time,
one of these qualities dominates the other two.
		</text>
		<text>

Next, the Lord says that the predominant
one among these qualities is known only by its effect.

'Avarice' is being unable to part with

'Restlessness' is the urge to keep doing,
even without purpose.

'Uneasiness' is the state in which our

[phalam] The outcome
[sukr'tasya karmaNa:] of action

		<text> [tu] On the other hand, [phalam] the outcome [rajasa:] of action driven by desire [du:kham] is sorrow.
		</text>
		<text> [phalam] The outcome [tamasa:] of lethargy [ajnAnam] is ignorance.
		</text>
		<text>



As described previously, a person who died with
a predominance of sattva is born in a community that realizes
the nature of the Self.
		</text>
		<text> In this birth, the person works well - without being
driven by desire, purely to worship Me.
		</text>
		<text> The reward for this is another birth
with enhanced knowledge and tranquility, untainted by any sorrow - those who
know the effects of sattva vouch for this.
		</text>
		<text>

On the other hand, if rajas
were to be predominant at the time of death, the person is born in a community
that's driven by results and desires.
		</text>
		<text> Being driven by desire, the person acts
accordingly and is born again to experience the results of such actions.
		</text>
		<text> Again,
he starts actions that are driven by desire.
		</text>
		<text> This loop of accumulation leads to
a greater experience of sorrow and disappointment in the material world.
		</text>
		<text> This
is said by people who know the true characteristics of this quality.
		</text>
		<text>

The outcome of lethargy is ignorance.
		</text>
		<text> The
predominance of tamas at the time of death results in a
chain of births in ignorant forms.
		</text>

Next, the Lord elaborates on the rewards
generated by a predominance of each of the three
qualities.

rewards one with flawlessness.

Thus, when sattva gains
more and more predominance over a sequence of births, the true nature of the
Self is realized.

		<text>

When rajas gains
predominance in this way, avarice takes over and we are driven by a longing for
'the good life'.
		</text>
		<text>

When tamas gains
predominance, people are careless and indulge in regrettable activities.
		</text>
		<text> From
this comes misconception.

As described, people who are situated in sattva ascend to eminence.
		</text>
		<text> They are progressive and gain
freedom from material bonds, achieving liberty.
		</text>
		<text> 

The quality of rajas
gives rise to avarice - people who are high on rajas covet
the good life.
		</text>
		<text> They yearn for fame, wealth and comforts.
		</text>
		<text> They work to achieve
those results.
		</text>
		<text> They are born again to experience the outcome of their work.
		</text>
		<text> Even
in the next birth, they work similarly and get stuck in the cycle.
		</text>
		<text> That's why
they stay mediocre.
		</text>
		<text> Due to its tendency to repeat, the quality of rajas inevitably causes sorrow for the most part.
		</text>
		<text>

Those in tamas stay
and work in undesirable ways.
		</text>
		<text> From one life to the next, they keep cultivating
conduct that grows the quality of tamas.

		<text> They progress to
lower forms - being born into depression, animals, insects, worms, germs,
immobile beings, plants and flowers, going on to become a blade of grass, a
stone, a stick, a lump of clay and so on.

Next, the Lord describes the way in which
people enrich sattva over several births.
		</text>

[dr'ShTA] An
intelligent person [na anupaShyati] doesn't see [kartAram] any cause of outcomes, [guNEbhya: anyam] Other than the three qualities.
		</text>
		<text> [yadA cha] And when [vetti] he knows [guNEbhya: param] beyond these qualities, [madbhAvam adhigachChati] he gains My state
of being.
		</text>
		<text>



In the Gita, it
is said that the Self takes initiative in every action
(Chap.13#20).
		</text>
		<text> It also says that the Self does not make outcomes happen, as in
Chap.13#29: 'definitely, actions are due to the environment' and in
Chap.3#27-28: 'An ignorant person thinks of his body as himself and does not
realize that actions are a result of the qualities of nature'.
		</text>
		<text> 

Though the first one seems to contradict
the other two, it doesn't.
		</text>
		<text> The Self takes initiative - it has an intent and
initiates action.
		</text>
		<text> What follows is the 'happening' - the action may happen
or not; the outcome may be perceived as favorable or unfavorable; he may feel
elated or disappointed - all of these are a result of the qualities of nature.
		</text>
		<text> 

These qualities attach to the Self as a
result of actions committed in the past.
		</text>
		<text> Actions are 'committed' when we
believe that what 'happens' is under our control and get attached to it,
instead of recognizing that outcomes happen as a result of the qualities of
nature.
		</text>
		<text>

The Self initiates
action.
		</text>
		<text> Outcomes happen as a
result of the qualities that bind the person.
		</text>
		<text>

A person suppresses the qualities of rajas and tamas comprehensively and
cultivates sattva.
		</text>
		<text> He does this by consuming food and nourishing
the body in-line with the quality of sattva.
		</text>
		<text> With work
that's done without attachments, only for the Lord's worship, he cultivates sattva.
		</text>
		<text> It then gains predominance in him.
		</text>
		<text> This person has
seen and uncovered the true nature of things.
		</text>
		<text> 

This Shloka says - ' Other than the three qualities, an intelligent person doesn't
see a cause of outcomes in anything else'.
		</text>
		<text> When such a person doesn't see
anything other than the three qualities in
making things happen, he knows beyond these qualities'

Meaning, such a person sees that the three qualities make outcomes happen in
accordance with their respective qualities.
		</text>
		<text> Having seen this, he realizes that
the Self does not make things happen.
		</text>
		<text> He realizes that the Self is distinct
from the qualities that make things happen.
		</text>
		<text>
Such a person shall attain My state of being; he becomes equivalent to Me.
		</text>
		<text> 

In summary, what the Lord said is - The
Self is pure and free by nature.
		</text>
		<text> It is limited by attachment to actions, due to
various deeds committed in the past.
		</text>
		<text> This causes its 'doership' in various
actions.
		</text>
		<text> By nature, the Self does not make things happen.
		</text>
		<text> It has the form of
pure and limitless knowledge.
		</text>
		<text> When a person realizes this true nature of the
Self, he attains equivalence to Me.
		</text>
		<text>

Having seen that the Self does not make
anything happen, that it is different from the qualities,
a person attains equivalence to the Lord - this has been said.
		</text>
		<text> What does it
mean to attain equivalence to the Lord? That is explained next.

ever-lasting.

		<text> [vimukta:] He is
free from [du:khai:] the sorrow
of [janma] birth, [mr'tyu] death [jarA] and old age.
		</text>
		<text>



The
three qualities of sattva, rajas and
tamas come from the environment.
		</text>
		<text> They have accumulated in
the form of a body.
		</text>
		<text> When the owner of the body crosses over these qualities and sees the Self, he is free from the
sorrow of birth, death and old age.
		</text>
		<text> The Self is in the form of pure knowledge,
entirely distinct from the qualities of
nature.
		</text>
		<text> He experiences the ever-lasting expanse of the Self - this is
equivalence to the Lord.
		</text>
		<text>

Now, Arjuna asks about the behaviors that distinguish
a person who has crossed over the three qualities.
		</text>
		<text>
He also enquires about the way to cross over these qualities.

[arjuna uvAcha] Arjuna said: [atItO] A person who has crossed over [trIn guNAn

qualities - [kai: lingai:]
with what characteristics [bhavati] is he present? 

[prabhO] Lord, [kim AchAra:]
what is his behavior [cha katham] and how does he [ativartatE] cross over [EtAn trIn guNAn] these three qualities?



When a person crosses over these three
qualities of sattva, rajas and tamas, what are the characteristics that distinguish him?
What are his behaviors? What actions give him this characteristic to realize
his Self? What is the method to cross over these three qualities?

[shrI bhagavAn uvAcha] The Lord said - 

[pAnDava] Arjuna, [prakAsham]
in knowledge, [pravr'tti] activity
[mOham cha] and misconception, [na dvEShTI] this person doesn't loathe [sampravr'ttAni] their presence.
		</text>
		<text> [nivr'ttAni] In their absence, [na kAMkShati] he does not yearn for them
either.
		</text>
		<text>



The
three qualities have their effects - the effect of sattva
is to illuminate and discover; rajas drives us to run
behind our desires; the effect of tamas is
misunderstanding and mistakes.
		</text>
		<text> 

A person who has crossed over the three
qualities isn't agitated when undesirable effects happen (for instance, when
he experiences a mistake due to the effect of tamas)
- these effects are not his Self.
		</text>
		<text> 

This person doesn't yearn for their effects
either, when they are denied to him (for instance, when he is unsuccessful
in learning something- the yearning for which comes from sattva)
- those desires are not the Self either.

		</text>
		<text>



Arjuna asked three questions about the
one who has crossed over the qualities - his characteristics, behavior and
method of crossing over the qualities.
		</text>
		<text> The characteristics were
covered in the previous Shlokas.
		</text>
		<text> This Shloka is about behavior and the next two
are about the method.
		</text>
		<text>

This person considers comfort and sorrow
equally by standing in his Self.
		</text>
		<text> Being content with his Self, he considers
everything else - joys and sorrows, births and deaths - with equanimity.
		</text>
		<text> In the
same way, he has the same outlook towards a lump of clay, a stone or gold,
weighing the favorable and the unfavorable equally.
		</text>
		<text> 

This person knows the Self from the body,
hence he weighs praise and insults equally - praise and insults relate to some advantages
and shortcomings, which are limitations of the body.
		</text>
		<text> 

They aren't related to the Self.
		</text>
		<text> If we care
for them, it is due to the misconception that the human form is the Self.
		</text>
		<text> This
misconception gives rise to fame, infamy, friendly and unfriendly perceptions.
		</text>
		<text>
Actually, none of them relate to the Self.
		</text>
		<text> 

In this way, the person relates equally to
all of them, being able to leave attachment to any pursuit that comes from
owning a body.
		</text>
		<text> This person is said to have crossed over the qualities.
		</text>
		<text>

Next, the Lord states the greatest enabler
in crossing over these qualities.

[ya: cha] And
the person who [mAm sEvatE]
serves and experiences Me [avyabhichArENa] with constant [bhaktiyOgEna] devotion [sa:
samatItya EtAni] will completely overcome these qualities.
		</text>
		<text> [kalpatE] He is cut out [brahmabhUyAya] to experience the Self in its true form.
		</text>
		<text>



The method of distinguishing the body from
the Self was described starting with Chap.14#19, 'When the person realizes that
the three qualities make things happen, not
the Self, nothing else.
		</text>
		<text>.
		</text>
		<text>.
		</text>
		<text>'.
		</text>
		<text> 

The three qualities can only be overcome by
surrendering to the Lord with devotion.
		</text>
		<text>

Just by knowing the distinction and
thinking about the Self and the body, a person doesn't earn the right to cross
over the three qualities.
		</text>
		<text> He is still checked
by the undesirable influence of past deeds - an influence that has lingered
from beginning-less time.
		</text>
		<text>

In this Shloka, the Lord says - 'I am the
One whose every intent is realized.
		</text>
		<text> I am the One with unsurpassed compassion,
an ocean of affection to those who surrender to Me.
		</text>
		<text> The
qualities are difficult to overcome.
		</text>
		<text> A person
crosses over them when he serves and experiences Me with constant devotion - a devotion that's distinguished by
its unwavering focus on one goal.
		</text>
		<text> This person is cut out to experience the Self
- he becomes fit to realize the Self.
		</text>
		<text> 

Meaning, he achieves the Self in its true
form, indestructible and inexhaustible.

[aham pratiShThA hi] I am the basis [brahmaNa:] of the Self, [amr'tasya] which is without death [avyayasya cha] and decay.
		</text>
		<text> [shAshvatasya dharmasya] I am the basis of the ever-lasting practice of devotion [EkAntikasya
sukhasya cha] and of complete joy.
		</text>
		<text>



The phrase 'I am the basis' is used here to
mean that the Lord is 'the cause of existence'.
		</text>
		<text>

The Lord says 'I am the One served and
experienced with unwavering devotion.
		</text>
		<text> I am the
basis of the Self that has neither death nor decay.
		</text>
		<text> In the same way, I am the
cause of unending devotion, as well as the
constant, infinite, absolute joy of being free'.
		</text>
		<text> 

This was described in Chap.7#19: 'Lord
Krishna is everything' - The Lord is the cause of joy achieved by the one who knows.
		</text>
		<text> 

Though the ever-lasting practice of devotion is a 'method' to achieve the Lord, it is
described before and after this Shloka as an achievement in itself.
		</text>
		<text> 

It is both a 'method' and the
'achievement', due to the fact that devotion and
the Lord always go together.
		</text>
		<text> This has been said before, starting in Chap.7#14 -
'These divine creations of Mine are pervaded by the three
qualities.
		</text>
		<text> They are indeed impossible to cross over.
		</text>
		<text> The people who surrender exclusively to Me will cross over this
material world'.
		</text>
		<text> 

The Lord said that surrendering to Him is
the only way to cross over material qualities.
		</text>
		<text>
Before crossing over, we pursue goals of self-realization, wealth and the Lord
Himself.
		</text>
		<text> Surrendering to Him is the way to achieve them as well.
		</text>
		<text> 

Only by surrendering exclusively to the
Lord can we cross-over material qualities and
gain equivalence to Him.

		<text>Chapter 15

The 13th chapter clarified the environment
as the field of action and the Self as
one who knows the field.
		</text>
		<text> Then, it
explained that the bond between the Self and the environment has no beginning.
		</text>
		<text>
Though the natural form of the Self is pure and unbounded knowledge, it is
bound in a body made from the environment.
		</text>
		<text> The Self is limited in this way, due
to the continuous flow of attachment to the three
qualities in the environment.
		</text>
		<text> This attachment has no beginning, it has
always been there.
		</text>
		<text>

The 14th chapter explained the state of the
Self, bound in the environment, both before creation and after.
		</text>
		<text> It stated that
the bond with the environment originates in the attachment to the three qualities.
		</text>
		<text> It also stated that the
bond is made by the Lord himself.
		</text>
		<text> It laid out the nature of our attachment to
the three qualities in detail.
		</text>
		<text>
Finally, it asserted that we cast away the attachment to material qualities by devotion
to the Lord.
		</text>
		<text> This devotion achieves the true
nature of the Self.
		</text>
		<text>

In this chapter, the Lord begins to explain
that He, as the object of worship, is the Supreme Person.
		</text>
		<text> He is the owner of
all that's perishable and imperishable, along with all beings that are made
from them.
		</text>
		<text> He is also the owner of all free beings.
		</text>
		<text> 

By being the owner, by repelling all that's
undesirable, by being pure prosperity, He is totally supreme and distinct from
anything else.
		</text>
		<text> The Self is The Lord's possession, known as The Eternal.
		</text>
		<text> It is free from all bondage after its bonds with the material
environment are cut off.
		</text>
		<text> 

Attachment to things that happen in the material environment become the bonds that
bind the Self.
		</text>
		<text> The sword of detachment is used to cut these bonds.
		</text>
		<text> To describe
this magnificent possession of the Lord, He illustrates this attachment as a
pepal tree with its roots at the top - the attachment must be cut.

ChandAmsi yasya parNAni yastam vEda
sa vEdavit || 1 ||
		</text>
		<text>

]

[shrI bhagavAn uvAcha] The Lord says:

[prAhu:] It is said that [ashvattham] the material world is like a pepal tree [avyayam] that does not wear out, [Urdhva mUlam] with its roots at the top [adha: shAkham] and branches at the bottom.
		</text>
		<text> [ChandAmsi
yasya parNAni] Its leaves are the Vedas.
		</text>
		<text> [ya: tam vEda] The person who knows this
tree [sa: vEdavit] is the one
who knows the Vedas.
		</text>
		<text>



The word [ashvattha] has been translated as 'pepal tree'.
		</text>
		<text> This word can also be broken
up as [shva:], which
means tomorrow, [ashva:]
meaning 'not tomorrow'.
		</text>
		<text> So [ashvattha:] means 'that which is not present tomorrow'.
		</text>
		<text> When this is used to
describe the material world, it illustrates the temporary nature of this world.
		</text>
		<text>
Yet, this Shloka says it does not wear out.
		</text>
		<text> How come? Read on.
		</text>
		<text>.
		</text>
		<text>.
		</text>
		<text>

Several scriptures refer to the material
environment as a pepal tree that doesn't wear out, with its roots on top and
branches below.
		</text>
		<text> The [kaThA
upanishat], 6-1 says 'With its roots at the top and branches below, this pepal tree
is ancient'.
		</text>
		<text> [yajur vEda],
1-11-5 says 'The person who knows the pepal tree well - with the roots above
and branches below - is the one who knows'.
		</text>
		<text>

Its roots are said to be at the top, since
the universe started with Brahma at the top.
		</text>
		<text> Brahma is the principal architect
who made the universe happen.
		</text>
		<text> The various beings of the universe - plants,
microbes, birds, animals and so on - are of different types, classified as
branches in the tree down below.
		</text>
		<text> We can't cut away the flow of material
experiences as long as we ignore reality and remain attached.
		</text>
		<text> In this way, the
tree, representing the material world, does not wear out.
		</text>
		<text> 

The leaves of this pepal tree are said to
represent the Vedas.
		</text>
		<text> The Vedas specify the methods to achieve material goals
like wealth and family.
		</text>
		<text> The world grows with these activities - hence the Vedas
are like the leaves of this tree.
		</text>
		<text> The growth of a tree is due to the
nourishment supplied by the leaves.
		</text>
		<text> 

The Vedas themselves specify the method to
cut ourselves free from the tree that's the material world.
		</text>
		<text> The person who
knows such a pepal tree is the one who knows the Vedas.
		</text>
		<text> This person knows the
nature of this tree, which must be cut.
		</text>
		<text> He also knows the method to cut his
attachment to it.
		</text>
		<text> Hence, he is called 'the one who knows the Vedas'.

		<text> [pravAlA:] Its shoots and sprouts [vishaya] are the stimuli in the

[adha: cha] The branches below [manuShya lOkE] in the world of humans [karmabandhIni] bind them with actions.
		</text>
		<text> [mUlAni anusantatAni] The
root has progressively become dense.
		</text>
		<text>



Humans and others
are the branches of the tree.
		</text>
		<text> This tree spreads its branches with the deeds of
humans.
		</text>
		<text> It sprouts more branches below, in the form of more humans and other
beings.
		</text>
		<text> It spreads branches above, in the form of more powerful beings.
		</text>
		<text> 

These branches expand with the three
qualities of sattva, rajas and tamas.
		</text>
		<text> Those shoots and sprouts are the stimuli present in
the environment - sounds, touch, form, taste and smell.
		</text>
		<text> How do the shoots and
sprouts figure over here? That is explained next -

This tree has Brahma, the principal
engineer of the universe, at its root at the top.
		</text>
		<text> It has humans down below in
its branches.
		</text>
		<text> These branches form the 'source' or the basis for activities
driven by desire.
		</text>
		<text> This is the base for us to get entangled in our actions.
		</text>
		<text>

In this way the branches sprout and get
progressively denser in the world of humans, with little influence from the
Brahma at the root.
		</text>
		<text> Human beings progress to higher and more powerful lives, or
get degraded to lower life forms, depending on their actions.

[iha] Over
here, [asya rUpam] the form of
this tree [na upalabhyatE] is
not apparent [tathA] in the
manner described before.

		<text> [na anta:] We cannot see its end, [na cha Adi:] its beginning, [na cha sampratiShThA] or the basis for its continued existence.

In the previous Shloka, the material world
was described as a tree.

		<text> Its roots represent Brahma, the principal engineer, at
the top.

		<text> Its branches below represent various generations of the human world.

Its branches have further spread upwards
and downwards based on the activities of humans.

		<text> This form of the material
world is not apparent to people who are bound in it.

us, such as 'I am a human', 'I am born to my parents', 'I am the parent of my

We cannot see its end either - it's not
apparent that this tree is cut off by the absence of attachment towards
material experiences.

		<text> Attachments are full of the three qualities.

		<text> It is not apparent that
ignorance is the basis of its continued existence.

overgrown roots [asanga shastrENa] using the weapon of decoupling [dr'DhEna] and strength, [tata: tat padam] that goal [parimArgitavyam] is to be sought - [yasmin gatA:] the state from which [na nivartanti bhUya:] people do not return anymore.
		</text>
		<text>



This pepal tree,
which was described before, is famous for its numerous well-grown roots and
shoots.
		</text>
		<text> By knowing it, a person uses the 'weapon of decoupling' to cut free of
their grip.
		</text>
		<text> 'Decoupling' is to leave attachment to experiences that are loaded
with material qualities.
		</text>
		<text> 

He well and truly cuts free with firm
perseverance.
		</text>
		<text>

Then, with the Self being free from the
stimuli of the environment, he must seek that permanent goal, entering which
people don't return anymore.
		</text>
		<text>

How can we get away from our in-built attachment
to experience materials and their qualities? These
attachments have been with us since beginning-less
time.
		</text>
		<text> The misconception that the body is the Self gives rise to such
attachments.

[prapadyEt] You
must surrender [tam Eva] to that very [puruSham] Person [yata:] from
whom [pravr'tti:] all existence
[prasr'tA] came forth [purANI] long ago.
		</text>
		<text>



The extent of your
entanglement doesn't matter.
		</text>
		<text> Surrender to the source and get free.
		</text>
		<text>

To get rid of ignorance, we must surrender to that very Person who is the origin of
everything - 'that very Person' is the Lord - He described Himself in
Chap.9#10: 'The material environment guides this world according to My will, I
being the supreme controller', in Chap.10#8: 'I am the origin of everything; Each
and every entity gets stimulated with the initiative given by Me' and in
Chap.7#7: 'There is absolutely nothing else that is superior to Me'.
		</text>
		<text>

In the entire created universe, 'binding
activities' spring forth from the Lord.
		</text>
		<text> These binding activities are full of
the three qualities and attachment to
experiences.
		</text>
		<text> 

The fact that the Lord is the origin and
that we must surrender to Him was described by the Lord Himself previously, in
Chap.7#14: ''These divine creations of Mine are pervaded by the three qualities.
		</text>
		<text> They are indeed impossible to
cross over.
		</text>
		<text> The people who surrender to Me alone -
they will cross over this material world'.
		</text>
		<text> 

There is an alternate way to read this
Shloka - the syllables in [prapadyEt yata: pravr'tti:] can also be read as [prapadya iyata:
pravr'tti:], which means 'By surrender,
the full extent of achievements are possible'.
		</text>
		<text> With this reading, the meaning
of the Shloka is:

By surrendering to that very Person who is
the origin of everything, all achievements - including the freedom from
ignorance - come forth in their full extent.

		<text> This way of surrender
is ancient and has been practiced by people who desire moksha.
		</text>
		<text>
It is in practice since beginning-less time.

The Lord says here - 'Since ancient times, those who desire moksha
have surrendered to Me and are free from all bonds'.

[amUDhA:] Those
who are free of ignorance, [nirmAnamOhA:] those who are free of the illusion that the body is the Self, [jita saMgadOShA:] those who have won over
the flaw of attachments, [adhyAtmanityA:] those who are constantly situated in the knowledge of the Self, [vinivr'tta kAmA:] those who have rid

the place that never withers.
		</text>
		<text>



In this way, those who surrender to Me are
free of the illusion that the body is the Self.
		</text>
		<text> 

They overcome the flaw of attachment to
material experiences, which are full of the three
qualities.
		</text>
		<text> They are situated in the knowledge of the Self constantly.
		</text>
		<text> They
are free of all desires, other than the desire to achieve the Lord.
		</text>
		<text> They are
free from the pulls of opposing-pairs, which people call comfort and sorrow.
		</text>
		<text> 

They distinguish the Self and the
environment in their individual forms.
		</text>
		<text> They reach the place that never withers
- they attain the Self in its true form, as the limitless expanse of knowledge.
		</text>
		<text>


All these behaviors are easily achieved by
My grace alone.
		</text>
		<text> Those who surrender to Me achieve
this in their journey to reach the supreme goal.

[sUrya:] The

such as fire.

reaching this, [na nivartantE]
they do not return.
		</text>
		<text> [tat dhAma]
That abode [paramam mama] is My
supreme attribute.
		</text>
		<text>



The Self is a part of
the Lord, the source of awareness.
		</text>
		<text>

The sun and moon cannot illuminate and
reveal the Self, nor can fire or any other source of light.
		</text>
		<text> Knowledge itself is
the one that illuminates everything! 

Light merely helps us by removing darkness.
		</text>
		<text>
Darkness blocks contact between our sense organs and the environment.
		</text>
		<text> When it
is removed, we perceive the illuminated environment.
		</text>
		<text>

The Self, on the other hand, is illuminated
by yoga.
		</text>
		<text> All deeds we committed stand opposed
to that illumination.
		</text>
		<text> Freedom from attachment, which
comes from surrendering to the Lord, removes the
effects of past deeds.
		</text>
		<text> This was described before.
		</text>
		<text>

In this Shloka, the Lord has said: 'After
reaching this goal, they do not return.
		</text>
		<text> That abode is My supreme attribute'.
		</text>
		<text>
That abode is supreme knowledge - the Self.
		</text>
		<text> It belongs to the Lord and is a
part of Him.
		</text>
		<text> 

This Self is 'supreme' by virtue of
illuminating the Sun itself.
		</text>
		<text> The sun and other sources of light do not
illuminate knowledge.
		</text>
		<text> Indeed, it is knowledge that lets us recognize the sun
and everything else!

]

[jIvalOkE] In
this material world, where every Self is bound in the environment, [sanAtana:] the ever-existing [jIvabhUta:] Self [mama
amsha: Eva] is definitely a part of Me.
		</text>
		<text> [karShati] It pulls together [ShaShThAni indriyANi] the six sense-organs [mana:] along with the mind [prakr'tisthAni] - all of them come from the
environment.
		</text>
		<text>



In this manner, even though each
ever-present Self is always a part of Me, it is enveloped by ignorance.
		</text>
		<text> This
ignorance is in the form of all the deeds it has committed
in the past.
		</text>
		<text> It is bound to the environment in various forms: being present in
an ordinary human, a powerful one, or any suitable form that's made from the
environment.
		</text>
		<text> Inside such a body, it pulls the six sense-organs together - the
organs of sight, sound, smell, touch, taste and the mind.
		</text>
		<text>

Occasionally, one Self frees
itself of ignorance in the manner described before.
		</text>
		<text> It then manifests in its
true form.
		</text>
		<text>

Before this, the Self is bound in a body
and has access to an extremely limited amount of knowledge.
		</text>
		<text> In this state, it
is the owner of the five organs of sense and the mind - inside a body made from
the environment, obtained according to past deeds.
		</text>
		<text> It attracts various experiences
in-line with those deeds.
		</text>

[Ishvara:] The owner [gr'hItva EtAni] carries the essence [yat sharIram] of the body [avApnOti] it gets to own, [yat cha] and the one that it [utkrAmati] leaves.
		</text>
		<text> [samyAti] It
departs [iva] like [vAyu:] the wind [gandhAn] that takes the fragrance [AshayAt] from its source.
		</text>
		<text>



In this Shloka, a difference is made in
the body we enter at birth and the one that we leave at death, since those are
not the same.
		</text>
		<text> Consider this - We are a single cell at conception.
		</text>
		<text> This is
followed by many cycles of new cells till we die.
		</text>
		<text>

The Self is the owner of its organs, made
from solids, liquids, gasses, energy and space.
		</text>
		<text> It gets to own them in a body
at the time of birth and leaves a body when it dies.
		</text>
		<text> It carries the essence of
its organs and departs.
		</text>
		<text> 

This is compared to the wind, which takes
the fragrance from its source.
		</text>
		<text> Fragrant things such as a garland, sandal and
musk contain fragrance.
		</text>
		<text> The wind carries that subtle smell from the source to
another place.
		</text>
		<text> The Self carries the essence of the organs in the same way.
		</text>
		<text>

The 'essence of the organ' is the sense
of experience that it gives.
		</text>
		<text> For example, an organ such as the ear gives
experiences like pleasure and irritation that come from listening to sound.
		</text>
		<text>

The organs involved are listed again by the
Lord in the next Shloka -

world.
		</text>
		<text>



The Self employs the six sense organs
including the mind.
		</text>
		<text> Each organ is suited to sense a stimulus in the
environment, like the ear senses sound.
		</text>
		<text> The Self works each organ to experience
the appropriate stimulus.
		</text>
		<text> In this way it experiences sound and other stimuli in
the environment.

[vimUDhA] The
ignorant [na anupashyanti] do
not recognize [utkrAmantam] the
Self when it departs from the body, [sthitam vA] or when it is situated in their own body, [bhunjAnam
cha] or even when it's experiencing the material world,
[guNAnvitam vA] when it is
bound in the three qualities.
		</text>
		<text> [jnAna chakShuShA:] Those endowed with the eyes
of knowledge [pashyanti] do see
it.
		</text>
		<text>



People who are ignorant do not recognize
the Self in the form of pure knowledge, distinct from the flesh that
constitutes a human form.
		</text>
		<text> They do not notice it in any circumstance - They don't
recognize the Self when it is born in flesh - in human form or any another form.
		</text>
		<text>
These forms are made out of the material world, full of the three qualities.
		</text>
		<text> 

They do not notice it when it has departed
from a specific body or even when it is situated inside a body.
		</text>
		<text> They don't even
recognize it when it's experiencing the stimuli in the environment, which are
again full of the three qualities.
		</text>
		<text>
Ignorant people are conceit in the opinion that the flesh, in the form of their
body, is their 'Self'.
		</text>
		<text>

People with the eyes of knowledge
definitely discern the flesh from the Self.
		</text>
		<text> They recognize the Self as being
distinct from the body, in every state.

even with perseverance - [achEtasa:] They remain without recognizing the Self.
		</text>
		<text>



Having surrendered
to Me, those who pursue techniques such as karmayoga
purify themselves from the inside.
		</text>
		<text> Then, through the eyes of yoga, they see the Self in themselves - even
while being situated inside the body, they see the Self in its true form, being
separate from the body.
		</text>
		<text>

Others who haven't surrendered
their Self to the Lord do not see the Self.
		</text>
		<text> Since they do not follow the path
of surrender, their mind is unprepared and so their
consciousness doesn't have the ability to recognize their Self.
		</text>
		<text>

Up until now, it was explained that light
removes darkness.
		</text>
		<text> Darkness prevents material stimuli from coming into contact
with our sense organs.
		</text>
		<text> The sun, the moon and sources of light such as fire get
rid of darkness, enabling us to perceive the material world.
		</text>
		<text> In this way, light
enables the eye to sense the material world.
		</text>
		<text> 

On the other hand, the Self illuminates
everything, even the sources of light.
		</text>
		<text> Being the light of awareness, it knows
and experiences everything.
		</text>
		<text> 

Previously, it was said that the Self is an
attribute of the Lord, both in its free form as well as in its bound form: Chap.15#6
said 'After reaching this free state of being, they do not return.
		</text>
		<text> That abode
is My supreme attribute'.
		</text>
		<text> Chap15#7 said 'In this material world, where every
Self is bound in the environment, the ever-existing Self is definitely a part
of Me'.
		</text>
		<text>

Whatever the Self is
aware of, that is also the Lord.
		</text>
		<text>

Next, the Lord states that the light given
by luminous sources such as the sun, which is a special outcome of material
creation, is also His attribute.

		</text>
		<text>



The Lord says- I am present at the heart of
all beings, the place where the awareness called 'consciousness' comes from.
		</text>
		<text>
This 'consciousness' is the awareness that brings the experience of
pleasantness, initiates the process of digestion and governs all activities
that are performed or stopped in all beings.
		</text>
		<text> In this way, I am at the core of
all beings, regulating everything by My will.
		</text>
		<text> The scriptures say the same:

[ya.
		</text>
		<text>aa], 3-11-2
says - 'He is the core of the Self in everyone, ruling them and pervading them
from the inside'.
		</text>
		<text>

[br'hadArAnyaka],
3-7-3 says - 'He who is situated in the earth.
		</text>
		<text>.
		</text>
		<text>.
		</text>
		<text>'

[br'hadArAnyaka],
3-7-22 says - 'He is present in the Self while being distinct from the Self.
		</text>
		<text> He
rules the Self from the inside'

[mahA nArAyaNa]
says - 'The heart is like a lotus flower facing downwards.
		</text>
		<text> Everything is
present within, in a subtle form'.
		</text>
		<text>

[ChAndOgya], 8-1-1
says - 'In this body, which is the Lord's place of residence, there is a small
lotus, with a small space.
		</text>
		<text> That space is the Lord in subtle form', after which
it goes on to describe the qualities of that space - its intent is always
fulfilled, it has infinite joy, it has no thirst and so on - these are the
qualities of the Lord.
		</text>
		<text>

In the [viShNu
purANa], 1-17-20 Prahlada tells his father - 'Vishnu is
the ruler of everything in the world, without exception, He pervades
everything'.
		</text>
		<text> 

[manu smr'ti],
12-122 says - 'He controls everything, being smaller and subtle beyond anything
else'.
		</text>
		<text>

[manu smr'ti], 8-92
says - 'The Lord, who is the controller and the regulator, is present at your
heart'

Hence, everyone's memory comes from Me.
		</text>
		<text>
This 'memory' is the awareness that comes from merely re-living a past
experience.
		</text>
		<text> Awareness is to infer and recognize things based on experiences
from various organs.
		</text>
		<text> 

Forgetfulness and the inability to reason
is from Me.
		</text>
		<text> The power to reason comes from Me, as well as the ability to anticipate,
says the Lord.
		</text>
		<text> This comes to us in the form of 'I have learnt this fact (a fact
like gravity); I see the situation (like a stone being tossed); I can reason
what's next (the stone will fall)'.
		</text>
		<text> The chain of events that happens after this
(the stone hurting someone) adds to our learning.
		</text>
		<text> In this Shloka, The Lord said
'All this comes from Me'.
		</text>
		<text> 

'I alone am to be known from all the Vedas'
- The Vedas describe natural phenomena like fire, wind, the Sun, the Moon, acts
of nature and so on.
		</text>
		<text> I am inside all of them, at the core of their Self.
		</text>
		<text> Hence,
I am the One to be known from all the Vedas.
		</text>
		<text> The words 'human', 'god' and all
others refer to the Self in them.
		</text>
		<text> The Vedas describe the methods of worshipping
the gods, along with the results of such worship.
		</text>
		<text> 

It is the Lord who is being worshipped by
all methods, being at the core of every Self.
		</text>
		<text>

'I make the end of the Vedas' - the Vedas
end in the fruits of the actions they prescribed.
		</text>
		<text> 'Making the end' here means
that the Lord makes the fruits - He is the One who gives the result stated in
the Vedas.
		</text>
		<text>

This was stated previously, starting with
Chap.7#21 and Chap.7#22: 'Which ever devotee likes to please what ever form
with dedication, I give stability to the same faith in each of them.
		</text>
		<text> With that
dedication, the person wishes to worship accordingly.
		</text>
		<text> By this he attains his
desires.
		</text>
		<text> These desires are given by Me alone' and in Chap.9#24: 'I am indeed
the enjoyer and the single Master of all services rendered to anyone or
anything.
		</text>
		<text> Those who crave for material wealth do not know Me as I am.
		</text>
		<text> Hence,
they fall back'.
		</text>
		<text>

'I am the One who knows the Vedas': All the
Vedas describe and address the Lord.
		</text>
		<text> The Lord says 'I know this fact'.
		</text>
		<text> Those
who speak other meanings of the Vedas do not know the Vedas - that is the
opinion expressed here.
		</text>
		<text>

'Hence, listen to the one summary of all
the Vedas from Me' - continues the Lord.

[imau puruShau]
The people [lOkE] in My
Universe [dvau] are of two
types - [kShara:] perishable [cha] and [akShara] imperishable.
		</text>
		<text> [sarvANi bhUtAni] All beings you see here [kShara:] are perishable.
		</text>
		<text> [kUTastha:] The ones who stay without deforming [uchyatE] are said to be [akShara] the imperishable.
		</text>
		<text>



In My Universe, the perishable and imperishable
beings are well-known.
		</text>
		<text> The person termed 'perishable' here is what we call
'living beings', starting with Brahma, the principal engineer of the material
world, right up to even single-celled organisms.
		</text>
		<text> It's in their nature to wither
and perish, being created in combination with materials.
		</text>
		<text> In this Shloka, they
are all bundled together as one person, since they all have a common
characteristic - they are bound in the material world.
		</text>
		<text>

The one who does not change, called as the
'imperishable' is free from the attachment to the inanimate material world.
		</text>
		<text> He
is free by nature and stays in his natural form.
		</text>
		<text> 

Without attachments to anything inanimate,
he does not have any characteristics to differentiate him.
		</text>
		<text> The rest of us are differentiated
by the body we are bound to.
		</text>
		<text> That includes Brahma too.
		</text>
		<text> 

Since the free Self
does not vary, he is also called as 'invariant'.
		</text>
		<text> Just as an anvil stays
invariant while forging, every Self remains without changing.
		</text>
		<text> Since all of them
are common in their characteristic of being free from the
material world, this Shloka groups them together as 'the imperishable'.
		</text>
		<text> 

This group is not restricted to those who
have been free forever - it also includes those who are free now, who were bound previously - as said in Chap.4#10:
'Many people have taken refuge in Me, discarding desire, fear and anger.
		</text>
		<text> They
fill Me in their minds.
		</text>
		<text> They have been purified by pursuing My knowledge in a
single-minded way and have attained My qualities' and in Chap.14#2: 'Having
gained this knowledge, they achieve My characteristics.
		</text>
		<text> They are not born again
even at the time of creation, nor do they perish when the universe perishes'

[tu] However, [uttama: puruSha:] the Supreme Person [anya:] is another one.
		</text>
		<text> [udAhr'ta:] He is known [paramAtmA iti] as the Ultimate Self.
		</text>
		<text> [yO] He [Avishya] pervades [lOkatrayam] the three domains [bibharti] and supports them.
		</text>
		<text> [avyaya:] He never wears out.
		</text>
		<text> [Ishvara:] He is the Supreme Lord.
		</text>
		<text>



The Lord is superior to
all of this.
		</text>
		<text>

In the previous Shlokas, it was mentioned
that those who are bound in the material world are perishable, while those who
are free from the material world are imperishable.
		</text>
		<text> 

However, the supreme person is neither of
them.
		</text>
		<text> He has distinct characteristics and is called the Ultimate Self in all
the scriptures.
		</text>
		<text> The reference [paramAtmA] - 'The Ultimate Self' implies that
the Supreme Person is distinct from both the bound and free
beings.
		</text>
		<text> 

How is He distinct? This Shloka states: 'He
pervades the three domains and supports them'.
		</text>
		<text> 

The Lord looks over them, hence they are
called as domains (the Sanskrit word [lOka], also used to mean the world and its people, comes from [lOkyatE], which means 'they are looked
over'.
		</text>
		<text> The English word 'domain' also comes from the Latin word dominus,
meaning 'the lord who looks over').
		</text>
		<text>

The three domains are known from the
scriptures.
		</text>
		<text> They are: Inanimate matter, Conscious beings who are bound with it,
Conscious beings who are free from it.
		</text>
		<text>

The Lord pervades all three of them as the
core of their Self and supports them.
		</text>
		<text> In this way, He is distinct from those
who are pervaded and supported by Him.
		</text>
		<text> This person, who has been described as
being distinct, is the Lord.
		</text>
		<text> 

He does not wear out.
		</text>
		<text> In this way, He is
unlike the material world, which does wear out.
		</text>
		<text> Since He is not bound by
matter, He is distinct from all beings that are attached to matter.
		</text>
		<text> By being
the Lord and controller of everything, He is unlike the other beings that are
free of the material world as well.

I am beyond the perishable, whose nature
was described previously.
		</text>
		<text> I am superior to the imperishable in its bound and in
its free state.
		</text>
		<text> The basis of this superiority was
explained in the previous Shloka.
		</text>
		<text> By this, I am well-known as the Supreme
Person in the world and in the scriptures.
		</text>
		<text> 

The 'world' beholds traditions and the
knowledge in them.
		</text>
		<text> Here, this word is used to mean the [smr'ti] - epics,
traditions and knowledge that are handed down from generation to generation.
		</text>
		<text> 

The Lord is famous as the Supreme Person
both in scriptures that are written down, as well as in the tradition and
knowledge handed down over generations.
		</text>
		<text>

The [shruti] scripture [ChAndOgya], 8-12-3 says - 'This Self
vacates the body and gains the supreme light of the Lord.
		</text>
		<text> The Self shines on
his own, in his own form.
		</text>
		<text> The goal he reaches is the Supreme Person'

A [smr'ti] story in [viShNu purANa], 5-17-33 says - 'Akrura
tells Kamsa that Krishna is definitely a portion of Vishnu, having come to the
Earth as an incarnation.

		<text> He is without a beginning, middle or end'.

Arjuna, [yO] the person who [jAnAti] knows [mAm] Me [puruShOttamam]
as the Supreme Person [Evam] in
this way [asammUDha:] without
any doubts in mind - [sa:] such
a person [sarvavit] knows
everything [mAm bhajati] and
worships Me [sarvabhAvEna] with
all emotions.
		</text>
		<text>



The Lord says in this Shloka - 'The person
who knows Me as the Supreme Person, without any doubts or suspicion'.
		</text>
		<text>
What's the Supreme Person like? 

The Supreme Person was described as being
distinct from all that's perishable and imperishable.
		</text>
		<text> This distinction comes
from the characteristics of never wearing out, pervading everything, supporting
everything and controlling everything.
		</text>
		<text> 

So, the Lord says - 'The Person who knows
Me as the Supreme Person knows everything - he knows all about the means to achieve
Me'.
		</text>
		<text>

In this Shloka, The Lord also says - 'This
person worships Me with all emotions'.
		</text>
		<text> 

To achieve me, this person worships Me by
all known means of worship.
		</text>
		<text> The affection I get by knowing everything about Me
and the affection I get by chanting everything about Me - both these affections
are born to Me, by worshipping Me as the Supreme Person.
		</text>
		<text>

Next, the Lord praises His realization as the
Supreme Person.

		<text>Chapter 16

The preceding three chapters illustrated many
facts.
		</text>
		<text>

They gave the distinction between the
environment and the Self;

They described their true characteristics
when they are separate and when they are combined - The fact that their
combination comes from attachment to the three
qualities and that their separation is given by detachment from these qualities;

They stated that the environment and the
Self belong to the Lord in all states of existence;

They also stated that the Lord is distinct.
		</text>
		<text>
His power and possessions are distinct from the non-conscious environment; also
distinct from all conscious beings, both bound and free - He is distinct by
virtue of having the Self and the environment as His attributes, by never
wearing out, by pervading, supporting and controlling everything;

The Lord was illustrated in His true form -
as the Supreme Being.
		</text>
		<text>

Next, The Lord
says that it's important to comply with His instructions, which are described
in the scriptures.
		</text>
		<text> He says this to establish the facts that were listed above.
		</text>
		<text>
He describes the classification of His creations as 'deva' and 'asura' - those
who comply with His instructions and those who don't.
		</text>
		<text>

Though the terms deva and asura
translate to gods and demons in mythology, here they are used to refer to the
adherence to rules.
		</text>
		<text> Devas aim to comply with the Lord's instructions in the
scriptures, while asuras don't have regard for those instructions.

]

[shrI bhagavAn uvAcha] The Lord said - [bhArata] Arjuna, [sampadam]
the characteristics [abhijAtasya] of a person who is born [daivIm] into the Lord's principles [bhavanti] are: 



[abhayam] Freedom from fear;

[sattva samshuddhi:] A clear mind;

[jnAnayOga vyavasthita:] Settled in the knowledge of the Self;

[dAnam] Generosity;

[dama:] Control over the organs;

[yajna:] Worship of the Lord;

[svAdhyAya:] Recitation of the scriptures;

[tapa:] Dedication of thought into performance;

[Arjava] Consistency in thought, speech and action;

[ahiMsA] Intolerance towards violence;

[satyam] Saying it 'as it is', in a way that's beneficial;

[akrOdha:] Freedom from anger;

[tyAga:] Leaving things that don't benefit the Self;

[shAnti:] Being content with the Self;

[apaishunam] Not speaking ill of others;

[bhUtEShu dayA] Compassion towards all beings;

[alOluptvam] Without attachments in material subjects;

[mArdavam] Without being harsh;

[hrI:] Modesty;

[achApalam] Unwavering;

[tEja:] The brilliance of leadership;

[kShamA] Forgiveness;

[dhr'ti:] Resolve;

[shoucham] Cleanliness;

[adrOha:] Being without putting another at a disadvantage;

[nAtimAnitA] Being without inappropriate pride.
		</text>
		<text>



This commentary explains each of the
above characteristics.
		</text>
		<text>

Freedom from fear.
		</text>
		<text> Fear is a discomfort that's
experienced when we imagine the sadness of undesirable happenings- being
separated from what we love and being associated with what we hate.
		</text>
		<text> The absence
of this fear is the characteristic of being 'free from fear'.
		</text>
		<text>

'A clear mind' comes from focusing the mind
inwards, losing attachment to the qualities of rajas and tamas.
		</text>
		<text>

This person 'Settles in the knowledge of
the Self' by dedicating to realize the Self and distinguish it from the
environment.
		</text>
		<text>

'Generosity' is to give away our earnings
to those who deserve it.
		</text>
		<text>

'Control over our organs' comes from the
regular practice of bringing the mind away from its pre-occupation with
material subjects.
		</text>
		<text>

'Worship of the Lord' is about doing our
duties without attachment to results, purely as worship to please the Lord.
		</text>
		<text>

The characteristic of 'reciting the
scriptures' comes from the awareness that they describe the Lord with all His
wealth and power, along with the methods to worship Him.
		</text>
		<text>

'Dedicating thought into performance' is
about performing tough tasks and gaining the ability to please the Lord.
		</text>
		<text>

'Consistency in thought, speech and action'
is to commit the same in thought, speech and action towards others.
		</text>
		<text>

Being 'intolerant towards violence' is to
abandon hurting others.
		</text>
		<text>

'Satya' is about saying it 'as it is', in a
way that's beneficial.
		</text>
		<text> This comes from saying what we have come to infer,
saying it in a way that's beneficial to all beings.
		</text>
		<text>

'Freedom from anger' is to free the mind of
the deformity that makes a goal out of hurting others.
		</text>
		<text>

Leaving things that don't benefit the Self -
is the character of giving up distractions that don't benefit our Self.
		</text>
		<text>

'Being content with the Self' comes from
the practice of restraining our organs from their tendency to go behind
material things.
		</text>
		<text>

The virtue of 'not speaking ill of others'
is about restraining statements that cause harm to others.
		</text>
		<text>

'Compassion towards all beings' comes from not
tolerating sorrow in anyone.
		</text>
		<text>

We are 'without attachments in material
subjects' when we don't crave for material experiences, nor do we cling on to them.
		</text>
		<text>

'Not being harsh' gives eligibility to
connect with virtuous people.
		</text>
		<text>

'Prudence' is about being embarrassed to do
things that are not to be done.
		</text>
		<text>

'Unwavering' is when we don't lose focus
even in the presence of distracting attractions.
		</text>
		<text>

The 'the brilliance of leadership' is to be
without subjugation in the face of opposition.
		</text>
		<text>

'Forgiveness' is to be free of agitation,
even when we perceive others inflicting discomfort upon us - without being
vindictive towards them.
		</text>
		<text>

'Resolve' is to affirm with determination -
we do things that are to be done and reject those that are not, even in the
face of great obstacles.
		</text>
		<text>

'Cleanliness' is to tune our external and
internal organs to be devoted to the Lord, as instructed by Him in the scriptures.
		</text>
		<text>

We 'do not work to put another at a
disadvantage' when we don't become obstacles to others - when we don't obstruct
the expression of their free will.
		</text>
		<text>

Arrogance is inappropriate pride.
		</text>
		<text> Freedom
from arrogance is to be without pride when it's not deserved.
		</text>
		<text>

A person born with the qualities associated
with a 'deva' would have the above properties.
		</text>
		<text> A 'deva' is one who intends to work according to the Lord's
principles.
		</text>
		<text> Such a person's character is to follow the instructions of the
Lord.
		</text>
		<text> A person 'born into' these characteristics is determined to dedicate his
life to these principles.
		</text>
		<text> The purpose of such a person's life is to accomplish
the above principles as the Lord's command.
		</text>
		<text>

Isn't it tough to
follow the Lord's instructions?

ajnAnam chAbhijAtasya pArtha sampadam
AsurIm || 4 ||
		</text>
		<text>

]

[pArtha] Arjuna, [AsurIm abhijAtasya] a person with an attitude of non-compliance
of the Lord's instructions [sampadam] has the following characteristics:



[Dambha:] Being righteous just to show-off;

[darpa:] Intoxicated by the experience of material attractions;

[atimAna:] Stuck in self-esteem;

[krOdha:] Anger;

[pAruShyam] Harshness;

[ajnAnam cha] and Ignorance.
		</text>
		<text>



'Being righteous just to show-off' is done
to become famous as a righteous person.
		</text>
		<text> 

Getting 'intoxicated by the experience of
material attractions' comes from the happiness that's bounded by our material
experiences, being unaware of activities that are recommended and those that
aren't.
		</text>
		<text>

We get 'stuck in self-esteem' when we
admire ourselves beyond what we know, going by our position or race.
		</text>
		<text>

'Anger' is a deformity that makes an
achievement out of another person's discomfort.
		</text>
		<text>

'Harshness' is to cause agitation in
innocent people.
		</text>
		<text>

'Ignorance' is being unaware of what is
superior (The Lord) and what is ordinary (The material world).
		</text>
		<text>
It's also about being unaware of the distinction between activities that are mandatory
and those that are forbidden.
		</text>
		<text>

These are the characteristics of a person
in whom the intent to break the Lord's instructions
is born.

[daivI] Compliance to the Lord's instructions [sampat] is an asset [vimOkShAya] for liberation.
		</text>
		<text>
[matA] The path of [AsurI] disregarding
for these instructions [nibandhanAya] is to bind a person in the material world.
		</text>
		<text>



The Lord's instructions were illustrated before in this chapter.
		</text>
		<text> They are to be complied with.
		</text>
		<text>
Such compliance is an asset that causes a person to work and to worship the
Lord through his work.
		</text>
		<text> It liberates us to gradually
achieve the Lord.
		</text>
		<text>

On the other hand, when we go against those
instructions, we gather baggage that drives us to lower and lower depths.
		</text>
		<text> Its
purpose is to bind us to the material world.
		</text>
		<text>

Having listened to this, Arjuna got
apprehensive about his own character.

		<text> [pArtha] Arjuna, [shr'Nu]
listen [Asuram] to the property of non-compliance [mE] from Me.
		</text>
		<text>



This world is a world of action - all
beings here are involved in activities.
		</text>
		<text> They commit virtue and vice over many
lives.
		</text>
		<text> At the time of creation, they come into being in two attitudes - the
attitude of compliance to the Lord's instructions and the attitude of
non-compliance.
		</text>
		<text> 

Under the influence of virtue and vice
committed over the ages, they are individually prone to follow the Lord's
instructions, or to break them.
		</text>
		<text>

Our attitudes are an
effect of deeds we committed in the past.
		</text>
		<text>

The asset of compliance to the Lord's
instruction was elaborated before.
		</text>
		<text> The Lord continues- Those with this asset are
born to a certain behavior and conduct, according to My
principles.
		</text>
		<text> Such conduct has been elaborated in the form of karmayOga, jnAnayOga
and bhaktiyOga.
		</text>
		<text>

Those with the intent to break the Lord's
instructions are born into different behavior and conduct.

Those who disregard the Lord's instructions do not know exertion from liberation
- they don't know the achievement of prosperity from the achievement of liberty, described in the scriptures.
		</text>
		<text>

They don't have a sense of cleanliness -
Here, 'cleanliness' is the qualification to perform as per the scriptures, both
in appearance as well as in essence.
		</text>
		<text>

They don't have a sense of conduct either -
the conduct required to maintain this cleanliness in both appearance and
essence.
		</text>
		<text> An example of this conduct is the practice of [sandhyAvandana], which involves bathing, acknowledging nature and regulating breath.
		</text>
		<text>
It is said in [manusmr'ti],
2.22: 'The man who does not practice [sandhyAvandana] and has no cleanliness and isn't qualified to perform'.
		</text>
		<text>

The word [satya] is about 'saying it as it is' - saying what we have known and
inferred, saying it with an intention to benefit our listeners.

disregard the Lord's instructions are incapable of this.

Those who disregard the Lord's instructions
say that the world is not controlled by the Lord - They do not agree that the
Lord's will is always accomplished, nor do they acknowledge that He controls
everything.

		<text> That goes against Chap.10#8, where the Lord reveals his real
nature: 'I am the origin of everything; Each and every entity gets stimulated with
the initiative given by Me'.

		<text>

They claim - 'Life is created by the
association between a man and a woman; how else does it happen? We see that
humans and animals are born out of the association between a male and a female,
don't we? Is there a different kind of birth? We don't see it anywhere.

this whole world is driven by desire'.

Arjuna said - [kA] 'What is [niShThA] the final state of achievement [tEShAm] of people [yE
yajantE] who persevere with faith [shraddhayA_nvitA:] and focus, [utsr'jya] disregarding [shAstra vidhim] the imperatives laid down
in the scriptures? [sattvam] Is
it in sattva, the state of serenity? [AhO] or [rajas] Or in rajas, being
resourceful? [tama:] Or in tamas, the state of laziness?'



What is the achievement of someone who
discards the methods in the scriptures and yet perseveres with faith and focus?
Is it the sattva state-of-being, in
which a person is serene? Is it, rajas,
being resourceful? Or is its tamas,
the state of laziness? 

This Shloka uses the word [niShThA] in the sense of 'achievement',
which refers to a stable state-of-being achieved by a person.
		</text>
		<text> 'Achievement'
here is to settle in one of the three qualities.
		</text>
		<text>
Arjuna asks if this person achieves the state of sattva, rajas or tamas?

In response to this question, the Lord
describes that the methods and forms of worship described in the scriptures are
according to the three qualities.
		</text>
		<text> To describe
this, the Lord shows that there are three areas of focus in the scriptures.

sAttvikI rAjasI chaiva tAmasI chEti

		<text>

]

[shrI bhagavAn uvAcha] The Lord said - [dEhinAm shraddhA] Those who own a body have focus [trividhA
bhavati] of three types: [sAttvikI] serene, [rAjasI]
resourceful [cha] and [tAmasI] lazy.
		</text>
		<text> [sA
svabhAvajA] It comes from their own state of being.
		</text>
		<text> [iti tAm shr'Nu] Listen to them.
		</text>
		<text>



Where does difficulty
come from?

Everyone who owns a body has three types of
focus.
		</text>
		<text> It comes from their own state of being.
		</text>
		<text> This 'state of being' is unique
to them.
		</text>
		<text> It is shaped by the influence of actions committed since ancient
times.
		</text>
		<text> It is specialized by their likes and dislikes, so their focus is
directed by their tastes in life.
		</text>
		<text> 

This 'focus' - [shraddhA] - is the eagerness in their endeavor, filled with the conviction
that it will achieve their belief.
		</text>
		<text> The influence of past deeds, the consequent
tastes and this focus make up the 'conduct' of the Self.
		</text>
		<text> This conduct comes
from contact with the three qualities.
		</text>
		<text>


It's possible to describe the three qualities only by their effects.
		</text>
		<text>
The three qualities come from experiencing things around us - things like our
body - which is composed out of these qualities.
		</text>
		<text>


We perceive the world by using our body,
our sense organs and our mind.
		</text>
		<text> This perception is a product of the three qualities and gives rise to the
conduct of the Self - in the form of motivation, tastes and focus.
		</text>
		<text>

Hence, this focus - [shraddhA] - is of three types - serene,
resourceful and lazy, going by the three
qualities of sattva, rajas and tamas.
		</text>
		<text> Listen to this focus and its
characteristics.
		</text>

		<text>

]

[bhArata]
Arjuna, [sarvasya] each
person's [shraddhA] focus [satvAnurUpA bhavati] is according to the
essence of his character.
		</text>
		<text> [ayam puruSha:] This person is [shraddhAmaya:] defined by his focus.
		</text>
		<text> [ya:] Whoever [yat shraddha:] has a focus, [sa Eva sa:] he is that itself.
		</text>
		<text>



The 'essence of character' is the core of
the body - the reason for the body's existence.
		</text>
		<text> This core of our body shapes
our focus.
		</text>
		<text> The core of our body is made from the three
qualities.
		</text>
		<text> In this way, focus is born on a subject based on the qualities
that make up the core of our body.
		</text>
		<text>

Here, the phrase 'essence of character' is
used to represent our body along with its organs and the mind, as told before.
		</text>
		<text> We are 'defined by our focus' - our personality is a
product of our focus.
		</text>
		<text> 

We end up as a product of whatever our
focus is.
		</text>
		<text> When we get focused on actions of virtue, their outcomes latch on to
us.
		</text>
		<text> In this way, the 'outcome of action' - our experience after committing an
action - comes primarily from our focus.
		</text>
		<text>

The Lord elaborates this very fact next:

[sAttvikA:]
People in whom sattva is predominant [yajaMtE] devote themselves to [dEvAn] those who follow the Lord's
instructions.
		</text>
		<text> [rAjasA:] People
who have a predominance of rajas go behind [yakSha rakShAMsi] illusive powers, which
they believe will guard and protect them.
		</text>
		<text> [anyE janA:] Other people [tAmasA:] with tamas [yajantE] get devoted to [prEtAn] the deceased [bhUtagaNAn cha] spirits and other
superstitions.
		</text>
		<text>



Our past gives the
qualities of our body and our outlook to life.
		</text>
		<text>

People with a predominance of sattva have the serene type of focus.
		</text>
		<text> With this, they devote themselves to those
who follow the Lord's instructions.
		</text>
		<text> This focus is free from sorrow.
		</text>
		<text> It provides
superior joy.
		</text>
		<text> This type of focus is 'serene' focus and it goes with sattva.
		</text>
		<text>

People with a predominance of rajas go behind power that appears to
guard and protect them from the undesirable.
		</text>
		<text> This is the resourceful type of focus, which has some joy mixed with difficulties.
		</text>
		<text>

Those with a predominance of tamas get devoted to spirits and other
forms of superstitions.
		</text>
		<text> This lazy type of focus
is high on sorrow with very little joy.
		</text>
		<text>

The scriptures specify rules and activities
for people having a predominance of any of the three
qualities.
		</text>
		<text> Performing accordingly with focus brings
outcomes, which are according to their qualities
as described above - when the activities don't go against the scriptures.
		</text>
		<text>

On the other hand, even activities such as
charity, penance and rituals do not yield any well-being when they are
performed in disregard of the scriptures - they go against The Lord's
instructions.
		</text>
		<text> Next, the Lord clarifies His opinion, firm at heart - that such
activities are disastrous.
		</text>
		<text>

Given an outlook, we
can choose to live in reality or live in vain.

[yE janA:] People who [samyuktA:] are associated with [dambha] hypocrisy [ahaMkAra] and arrogance [balAnvitA:] find their strength [rAga] in desire [kAma]

		<text> [tapyantE] They
torment themselves [ghOram tapa:] with awful struggle, [ashAstravihitam] going against My instructions in the scriptures.

[karshayanta:] They attenuate [bhUtagrAmam] the colony of elements [sharIrastham] present as the body [chaiva] along with [mAm] Me, [anta: sharIrastham] present as the core of the body.
		</text>
		<text> [achEtasa:] They are lifeless.
		</text>
		<text> [tAn viddhi] Know them [Asura nishchayAn] as people who have resolved to disregard My instructions.
		</text>
		<text>



The statement 'People torment themselves
with awful struggle, going against my instructions in the scriptures' is
illustrative - any struggle that goes against My instruction is awful, even
when it involves impressive rituals such as charity and sacrifice.
		</text>
		<text> Such an
activity has hypocrisy and arrogance built-in, finding strength in desire and
pleasure.
		</text>
		<text>

These activities attenuate the specialty of
the body - they diminish the body, not recognizing that it's a wonderful colony of the five elements - solids, liquids,
energy, gasses and space.
		</text>
		<text> They also diminish the Self, a part of Me present as
the core of the body.
		</text>
		<text> 

Know that people who struggle this way have
resolved to disregard My instructions.
		</text>
		<text> They are the very people who go against
My instructions.
		</text>
		<text> By doing so, they don't get to touch even a little joy.
		</text>
		<text>
Instead, they fall into the company of the vain and wasted, as said before in
Chap.16#16: 'Indulging in their desires and experiences, they fall into foul
torment'

In addition to activities to achieve The
Lord, the scriptures describe activities related to our environment.
		</text>
		<text> Next, The
Lord goes on to distinguish activities that relate to our environment.
		</text>
		<text> These
activities are characterized by the three
qualities.
		</text>
		<text>

Food is the source of these activities -
hence, He first describes the three types of food that nourish the three qualities.
		</text>
		<text> As said in [ChAMdOgya, 6-5, 4] - 'Son, the mind is
defined by the food we eat' and in [ChAMdOgya, 7-26-2] - 'The quality of sattva gets pure when our
food is free of impurities'.

The favorite food [sAttvika] of
people in the sattva quality [vivardhana:] enhances [Ayu:]
longevity; [satva] it enhances

		<text> [rasyA:] They are
tasty, [snigdhA:] being mild

provide comfort to the mind.

Food builds our body
and the qualities in it.
		</text>
		<text>

Those who have chosen to be in sattva prefer food that is made in the quality of sattva.
		</text>
		<text> Any food made in sattva
contributes to longevity, further enhancing the quality of sattva.
		</text>
		<text>


Sattva is the seat of
thought and experience.
		</text>
		<text> The knowledge that contributes to the realization of
our Self is called sattva here.
		</text>
		<text> It was said in
Chap.14#17: 'From sattva, knowledge arises'.
		</text>
		<text> Since sattva causes knowledge to be enriched, food that is made in
sattva also contributes to enriching our knowledge.
		</text>
		<text> 

Further, it enhances strength and keeps us
healthy.
		</text>
		<text> It brings love and well-being as well - When it is digested in the
body, it automatically contributes to our well-being.
		</text>
		<text> Then, by initiating work
that brings love, it enhances love too.
		</text>
		<text> 

Such food is tasty - having fluids that are
pleasant to taste.
		</text>
		<text> They are mild and smooth - buttery for example.
		</text>
		<text> They are preserving
- their effect on us is stable.
		</text>
		<text> They provide comfort to the mind - they are
pleasing to the eyes.
		</text>
		<text> A person in sattva prefers these
foods, which are made in the quality of sattva.

salty, [ati uShNa] full of

		<text>



Pungent and sour juices mixed with a lot of
salt, made very hot, sharp and rough to the taste, have a scorching effect.
		</text>
		<text> The
sharpness comes from excessive cold or excess of heat, making the food
difficult to consume.
		</text>
		<text> They parch and hence are rough to the taste.
		</text>
		<text> Their heat
has scorching effects.

People in rajas like these
foods.

		<text> Since they are made in the quality of rajas, they
are difficult to consume and cause distress.

Food gets aged when it is left for a long time.

It loses its natural flavor and becomes foul-smelling.

It is said to be 'stale' when it acquires a
different taste due to the passage of time.

		<text> Left-over fragments are the remains
after other creatures have consumed their food.

		<text> Other 'dirty things' are foods
we consider so dirty that we can't consider them for worship.

It is liked and consumed by creatures who are in tamas.

Discipline that's [kriyatE]

revered, [dambhEna] to gain
fame, [satkAra] respect, [mAna] pride [dambhEna

[chalam] It is perishable [adhruvam] and unstable.

'Respect' is the regard in people's minds.
		</text>
		<text>
'Pride' comes from spoken praise.
		</text>
		<text> 'Being revered' is when people show respect,
by bowing down for instance.
		</text>
		<text> 

When discipline is practiced to show-off,
expecting enhanced respect, praise and reverence, it is said to be in the
quality of rajas.
		</text>
		<text> Such discipline is practiced to
accomplish goals like prosperity and comfort, so it's perishable - The fact
that it's associated with the fear of losing whatever is gained makes it
perishable.
		</text>
		<text> It is unstable, since it wears out over time.

[Om tat sat iti] 'Om', 'tat', 'sat' are [trividha:

activities in the Lord's scriptures.
		</text>
		<text> [vEdA:] The Vedas, [brAhmaNA:] people in the quest for the Lord [yajnA:

with these sounds.
		</text>

The word [brahma] here refers to the activities specified by the Lord.
		</text>
		<text> 'Om', 'tat'
and 'sat' are three sounds that give direction when they are applied to worship,
discipline and charity in the scriptures.
		</text>
		<text> 

The sound of 'Om'
points to a higher purpose

The sound 'Om' is a component of every work
prescribed by the Lord in the Vedas.
		</text>
		<text> It is chanted at the start of an endeavor.
		</text>
		<text>
The other two words 'tat' and 'sat' come from an expression of admiration.
		</text>
		<text> 

In this shloka, the Lord stated that the
Vedas, the people who practice them and the forms of worship were established
long ago by Him - along with the application of 'Om', 'tat' and 'sat'
directives.
		</text>
		<text> Next, The Lord illustrates the way in which the sounds of 'Om',
'tat' and 'sat' associate.

[tasmAt] That's
why [kriyA:] the activities of [yajna dAna tapa:] worship, charity and
discipline [satatam pravartantE] are always started [udAhr'tya] by saying [Om iti]
the sound of Om, [vidhAnOkta:]
as specified [brahmavAdinAm]
for people who follow the Vedas.
		</text>
		<text>



Those who go by the Lord's instructions
begin their work with the sound of 'Om'.
		</text>
		<text> That's the method specified for people
who follow the Vedas.
		</text>
		<text> The Vedas themselves begin with the sound of 'Om'.

of 'Om' in the Vedas and its application to worship, charity and discipline.

		<text>
Everyone in the quest for the Lord is associated with this sound.
		</text>
		<text> They carry
the Lord's instruction with the sound of Om.

[kriyA:]
Activities in the form of [yajna] worship, [tapa:]
discipline [cha] and [vividhA:] various kinds of [dAnakriyA:] charitable deeds [kriyantE] are done [phalam
anabhisandhAya] without being bogged down by
expectations [mOkSha kAMkShibhi:] by those who desire moksha, [tat iti] saying the word 'tat'.
		</text>
		<text>



Worship, discipline, charity and the study
of the Vedas are activities to achieve the Lord.
		</text>
		<text> People who desire moksha follow them.
		</text>
		<text> They aren't bogged down by expectations.
		</text>
		<text>


These activities are distinguished by the
sound of 'tat', which points to Brahma.
		</text>
		<text> 

'Brahma' indicates an expanse.
		</text>
		<text> The expanse
of the universe, the expanse of knowledge - they are all part of the Lord.
		</text>
		<text>

The Lord, as the
highest purpose, has great expanse.
		</text>
		<text>

The word 'tat' is famously used in the
Vishnu Sahasranama to name the Lord - it mentions the names of the Lord as - [sa: va: ka: kim yat tat padam anuttamam].
		</text>
		<text> 

The word 'tat' is present in the Gayatri
Mantra as well - [tat savitu: varENyam].
		</text>
		<text> It signifies the expanse of knowledge.
		</text>
		<text>

In this way, the sound of 'tat' points to
the study of Vedas, as well as activities such as worship, which accomplish the
goal of moksha.
		</text>
		<text> The word 'tat' is applied to all those activities.
		</text>
		<text>
Those who are in the quest for the Lord will do these activities to achieve moksha.
		</text>
		<text> Those people are also associated with the sound of
'tat'.
		</text>
		<text>

Next, the Lord describes the origin of the
word 'sat', before explaining the way in which the sound of 'sat' applies to
these activities.

[pArtha]
Arjuna, [Etat] this [sat iti] sound of 'sat' [prayujyatE] fits [sadbhAvE] in the belief of existence [cha] and [sAdhubhAvE] in
the opinion that something is favorable.
		</text>
		<text> [tathA] Further, [sat shabda:] the 'sat' sound [yujyatE] is linked [prashastE karmaNi] in praiseworthy actions.
		</text>
		<text>



That purpose exists and
it always brings excellence.
		</text>
		<text>

The 'belief of existence' happens when we
sense or foresee the existence of something.
		</text>
		<text> The 'opinion that something is
favorable' comes from the belief that it would bring benefit.
		</text>
		<text> 

This usage of the word 'sat' fits all situations
of this world.
		</text>
		<text> The Vedas use it in this way as well.
		</text>
		<text> It is used to express
excellence in the favorable actions prescribed by the Lord.

		<text> [karma] The actions [tadarthIyam

Hence, the actions of worship, discipline

		</text>
		<text> These
actions are specified by the Lord and done by people who follow the Vedas.
		</text>
		<text> These
people are also called 'sat'.
		</text>

The Vedas and their activities are denoted
by the word [brAhmaNa] -
meaning they are related to the Lord.

characterized by their association with the sounds of 'Om', 'tat' and 'sat'.

		<text>Chapter 18

The previous two chapters spoke about activities
like worship, discipline and charity - as specified in the Vedas.
		</text>
		<text> They explained
that the achievements in this world, as well as supreme joy (Moksha)
come from such activities, not from other sources.
		</text>
		<text> 

All these activities are associated with
the sound of 'Om', which is about a higher purpose.
		</text>
		<text> It is the common
characteristic of all activities in the Vedas.
		</text>
		<text> 

The words 'tat' and 'sat' give the
distinction between the achievement of Moksha and the achievements in this
world.
		</text>
		<text> Activities like worship lead to Moksha, when they are not bogged down by
expectations.
		</text>
		<text> Such activities commence in an abundance of sattva.
		</text>
		<text>
This quality is enhanced by nurturing the body with food that's made in the
quality of sattva.
		</text>
		<text>

Next, this chapter explains that [tyAga] - 'letting go' and [saMnyAsa] - 'renunciation' are synonymous.
		</text>
		<text>
Their purpose is to achieve Moksha.
		</text>
		<text> It goes on to describe the characteristics
of 'letting go', which is the scheme of placing all transactions in the Supreme Lord.
		</text>
		<text> 

This chapter also describes the effects of sattva, rajas and tamas
and the inevitable excellence of sattva.
		</text>
		<text> It illustrates
the way to achieve of the Lord with activities that are natural to us.
		</text>
		<text> We
worship the Lord with our normal activity.
		</text>
		<text> 

These Shlokas state that devotion to the Lord is the summary of the entire
text of the Gita.
		</text>
		<text>

While going into this summary, Arjuna first
wants to determine if 'letting go' is same as 'renunciation', or if they're
something different.
		</text>
		<text> Here, the phrase 'letting go' is to lose possessiveness
towards our actions and their outcomes; 'renunciation' is about giving up
actions themselves.
		</text>
		<text> He asks to know their characteristics.

[arjuna uvAcha]
Arjuna said - [ichChAmi] I
would like [vEditum] to know [tattvam] the true nature [saMnyAsasya] of renunciation, [cha] as well as [tyAgasya] the true nature of 'letting go' [pr'thak] distinctly.
		</text>
		<text> [hr'ShIkEsha] O Lord, you are the Self in everything, controlling all, [mahAbAhO] you have mighty arms, [kEshi niShUdana] you have destroyed Keshi.
		</text>
		<text>



Keshi is the name of a demon.
		</text>
		<text> This word
represents everything that goes against virtue and things that stand in the way
of virtuous people.
		</text>
		<text> The Lord destroys such things.
		</text>
		<text>

Renunciation and the practice of 'letting
it go' are specified as means to achieve Moksha.
		</text>
		<text> 

It is said in the [mahAnArAyaNa] - 'Freedom from death comes by letting go.
		</text>
		<text> It does not come with deeds,
wealth or by having followers.
		</text>
		<text> Those who practice the art of 'letting go' know
the essence of the Upanishads.
		</text>
		<text> They get purified by being with renunciation.
		</text>
		<text> At
the end of life, they are in the Lord's abode.
		</text>
		<text> They attain the Lord, who is
supreme.
		</text>
		<text> The Lord is beyond those who have gained freedom from death'.
		</text>
		<text>

In this way, the scriptures seem to use the
phrases 'letting go' and 'renunciation' interchangeably.
		</text>
		<text> Hence, the question if
they are same or different.
		</text>
		<text>

In this quest of
purpose, what do we let go of?

Arjuna asks - I would like to know the true
nature of this 'renunciation' and how it's different from 'letting go'.
		</text>
		<text> To
elaborate: Do the phrases 'renunciation' and 'letting go' mean the same, or are
they different? If they are different, I'd like to know their characteristics
and their distinctions.
		</text>
		<text> On the other hand, if they mean the same thing, let me
know its nature.
		</text>
		<text>

The Lord now starts acknowledging the
discussions where they appear distinct.
		</text>
		<text> He later clarifies that their
characteristics are the same and describes those characteristics.

]

[shrI bhagavAn uvAcha] The Lord said - [kavaya:] The wise [vidu:]
know that [saMnyAsam]
renunciation [nyAsam] is to
leave [kAmyAnAm karmaNAm]
actions that come from desire.
		</text>
		<text> [vichakShaNA:] Those who are experienced [prAhu:] say that [tyAgam]
'letting go' [phala tyAgam] is
about giving up expectation [sarva karma] in all actions.
		</text>
		<text>



Some learned people believe that all
actions are driven by desire, so they believe in leaving actions themselves -
not doing them at all.
		</text>
		<text> This is 'renunciation'.
		</text>
		<text> 

Others with experience believe in letting
go of expectation in all actions.
		</text>
		<text> This is called 'letting go' in all scriptures
that deal with Moksha.
		</text>
		<text> The phrase 'all actions' here includes routine actions,
prescribed actions and other activities having various outcomes.
		</text>
		<text> 

Here, the Lord illustrates the contention
between two phrases - 'renunciation' and 'letting go', both of which have been
used in the scriptures.
		</text>
		<text> 

Does 'letting go' mean that we must leave
expectations in our actions or leave the actions themselves? Does renunciation
mean ceasing all actions? The Lord has used the phrase 'renunciation' in some
places and 'letting go' in others interchangeably, affirming that they mean the
same.
		</text>
		<text> 

As He says in the next few Shlokas-
Chap.18#4: 'Arjuna, listen to My firm conclusion about letting-go' - with this,
He conveys His conclusion using the phrase 'letting go' itself.
		</text>
		<text> In Chap.18#7,
He says - 'It is not appropriate to renounce activities that are prescribed.
		</text>
		<text>
Getting confused and letting go of them is said to be in laziness, a quality of
tamas'.
		</text>
		<text> 

In Chap.18#12, He says - 'Actions have
three types of results - desirable, undesirable and mixed.
		</text>
		<text> They follow a person
who hasn't let-go, even after he departs from this world.
		</text>
		<text> In the next life, he
is born again in one of these three situations.
		</text>
		<text> None of this happens to someone
who has renounced'.
		</text>
		<text>

In this way, the Lord has mutually
substituted the phrases 'renunciation' and 'letting go'.
		</text>
		<text> Hence, it is accepted
that they have the same meaning.

tyAgO hi puruSha vyAghra trividha:
saMprakIrtita: || 4 ||
		</text>
		<text>

]

[bharatasattama] Arjuna, [shr'Nu]
listen [mE nishchayam] to My
resolution [tatra tyAgE] in the
meaning of 'letting go'.
		</text>
		<text> [hi]
Indeed, [tyAga:] 'letting go' [saMprakIrtita:] is mentioned [trividha:] in three ways, [puruSha vyAghra] O man of courage!



Listen to My
resolution in this matter of perplexing declarations of 'letting go'.
		</text>
		<text> In work
that complies to the scriptures, I have explained the concept of 'letting go'
in three ways - let go the outcome of action, let go of possessiveness in
actions and let go of the belief that you have made it happen.
		</text>
		<text> 

I explained this before in Chap.3#30: Fight
without grief, dedicating all actions in Me, keeping your mind in the Self and
the Lord, being uninterested in the fruits of action, without feeling 'it is
mine'.
		</text>
		<text> 

Let go of outcomes and
possessiveness.
		</text>
		<text> Don't be the reason.
		</text>
		<text>

The first way is to let-go the outcome of
our actions - outcomes such as comfort and enjoyment - with the conviction that
'they are not mine'.
		</text>
		<text> This is called [phala tyAga].
		</text>
		<text>

In terms of doing the action, it's to let-go
of the belief that 'Actions are mine because their outcome is for me'.
		</text>
		<text> It's
about letting go of possessiveness in actions.
		</text>
		<text> This is [mamatA
tyAga].
		</text>
		<text>

Leaving the belief that we make things
happen is to let-go of the belief that the Self is the agent of actions.
		</text>
		<text> This
is done by placing the Lord as the One who makes all actions happen.
		</text>
		<text> This is [kartr'tva tyAga].
		</text>
		<text>

[karma] Actions
of [yajna] worship, [dAna] charity, [tapa:] and discipline [na tyAjyam] are not to be given up.
		</text>
		<text> [tat] Such action [kAryam Eva] must certainly be done.
		</text>
		<text>



A person who desires Moksha
must not abandon worship, charity, discipline and other activities prescribed
in the scriptures.
		</text>
		<text> Instead they must be performed daily, till the time a person
departs from the body.
		</text>
		<text>

Why do these activities need to be done?

[yajna:]
Worship, [dAna] charity [cha] and [tapa:] discipline [pAvanAni Eva] are definitely purifying [manIShiNAm] for intelligent, devout people.
		</text>
		<text>



Actions such as worship, charity and
discipline are duties that are 'purifying' for intelligent, devout people.
		</text>
		<text>
These are the people who adore the Lord.
		</text>
		<text> They desire Moksha
and worship the Lord as long as they are alive.
		</text>
		<text> These actions 'purify' by
destroying the effects of past deeds - effects that could hinder our complete
adoration for the Lord.

[pArtha]
Arjuna, [EtAni api tu] even
these [karmANi] activities [kartavyAni] are to be done [tyaktvA] by leaving [saMgam] attachment [cha] and [phalAni]
expected outcomes.
		</text>
		<text> [iti] This
is [mE] my [nishchitam] definite [uttamam matam] and supreme opinion.
		</text>
		<text>



While activities such as worship, charity
and discipline are purifying for devout and intelligent people, do them as a
way to adore Me.
		</text>
		<text> Leave attachment and keep expected outcomes aside.
		</text>
		<text> Give up
possessiveness towards those actions.
		</text>
		<text> 

Those who desire Moksha
work in this manner.
		</text>
		<text> Till they depart from the body, they consider their
activities as My worship.
		</text>
		<text> This is My definite, ultimate opinion.
		</text>
		<text>

This Shloka said that when activities such
as worship, charity and discipline are carried out, they are to be done without
attachment.
		</text>
		<text> Next, the Lord says that routine and prescribed activities are
mandatory.

mOhAt tasya parityAga: tAmasa:

		</text>
		<text>

]

[tu] On the
other hand, [saMnyAsa:] the
renunciation [nityasya karmaNa:] of routine, prescribed activities [na
upapadyatE] is not appropriate.
		</text>
		<text> [parityAga:] Giving them up [mOhAt] in confusion [parikIrtita:] is said to be [tAmasa:] in the quality of tamas.
		</text>
		<text>



Don't give up activity.
		</text>
		<text>

It isn't appropriate to renounce or give up
routine and prescribed activities.
		</text>
		<text> These are activities such as eating,
breathing and worshipping.
		</text>
		<text> 

As said in Chap.3#8: 'Even the journey
through your body wouldn't be achieved when you are inactive' - Don't give up
activities in this journey through your body.
		</text>
		<text> This journey itself works to gain
the knowledge that liberates us, by consuming the balance
that remains from worship.
		</text>
		<text> Otherwise, as said in Chap.3#13: 'The kleptomaniacs
who enjoy the results for their own sake will only experience misfortune'.
		</text>
		<text> 

In this way, when the body is built from
food other than the food that is derived from worship, it acts as a contaminant
and forms the base of false knowledge.
		</text>
		<text> 

Food nourishes the mind, as said in [chAndOgya], 6-5-4: 'Son, the mind is
constituted from the food we eat'.
		</text>
		<text> Again, as said in [chandogya], 7-26-2: 'When the food is pure, the mind is not contaminated.
		</text>
		<text> A
clean mind is capable of strong awareness.
		</text>
		<text> All knowledge can be released with
the strength of this awareness'.
		</text>
		<text> 

Thus, it is learnt that knowledge to
realize the Self rests on the sanctity of the food we consume.
		</text>
		<text>

That's why it's not appropriate to give up
routine, prescribed activities in this journey through the body.
		</text>
		<text> Routine
activities such as eating and prescribed activities such as worship are meant
for knowing the Self.
		</text>
		<text> 

The quality of tamas
gives rise to the misconception that these actions are binding in nature -
though in reality, such actions actually lead to knowledge that liberates us.
		</text>
		<text>
When we give up these activities due to such misconceptions, we remain in the
quality of tamas.
		</text>
		<text> Indeed, the quality of tamas
is the source of ignorance.
		</text>
		<text> As said in Chap.14#17: 'Mistakes, misconceptions
and ignorance come from the quality of tamas'.
		</text>
		<text>

Ignorance is made from misconceptions that
repel knowledge.
		</text>
		<text> Further in this chapter, it is said in Chap.18#32: 'People are
overwhelmed by the quality of tamas when they understand
their duty to be contrary to prescribed actions.
		</text>
		<text> Their intentions are born in
the quality of tamas and go against any kind of
achievement'.
		</text>
		<text>

In this way, misconceptions result in
giving up routine and prescribed activities.

]

[yat karma]
Work that's [tyajEt] given up [du:kham iti Eva] just because it's
difficult, [bhayAt] due to fear
[kAya klEsha] that it would
strain the body - [tyAgam kr'tvA] abandoning work in this way [rAjasam] is done in the quality of rajas.
		</text>
		<text> [sa:] The person who abandons work in this way [naiva] will certainly not [labhEt] gain [tyAga phalam]
any benefit from such 'sacrifice'.
		</text>
		<text>



Even in the belief that these actions are
liberating in nature, people abandon duties such as worship due to
apprehensions - They are apprehensive that those activities need material, time
and a lot of effort, causing strain on the body.
		</text>
		<text> 

In the apprehension that they wouldn't be
able to sustain these activities, they give up actions while being in the
quality of rajas.
		</text>
		<text> They try to achieve their goals by contemplating
through meditation.
		</text>
		<text> 

They misunderstand the scriptures and miss the
awareness that naturally comes from letting go.
		</text>
		<text> It is
said in Chap.18#31: 'Forcing an understanding that was never meant is in the
quality of rajas'.
		</text>
		<text> The actions that we do and experience
are never a cause of delight.
		</text>
		<text> Actually, the delight we experience comes from
the delight of the Lord.

[arjuna]
Arjuna, [yat karma niyatam]
work that's prescribed, [kriyatE] done [kAryam iti Eva] with an attitude that 'It must be done', [tyaktvA] letting go of [saNgam] attachment [phalam chaiva] and outcomes - [sa tyAga:] Such an act of 'letting go' [mata:] is regarded as [sAtvika:] being in the quality of sattva.
		</text>
		<text> 



Activities like the various rituals are
'prescribed' to a person according to his role in society and the stage of his
life.
		</text>
		<text> They are to be performed as My worship.
		</text>
		<text> 'Letting go'
is about performing these activities with My worship itself as the purpose,
without attachments - without being possessive towards those actions and their
outcomes.
		</text>
		<text> 

'Letting go' in
this way is regarded as being in the quality of sattva.
		</text>
		<text>
This is the first step to sattva - the first step to gain
clear knowledge of the Lord's words in the scriptures.
		</text>
		<text> 

It is said that the quality of sattva alone gives clarity of knowledge, letting us see
things in their true form - as said in Chap.14#17: 'From the quality of sattva, knowledge arises'

Further in this chapter, it is said in
Chap.18#30: 'The person who knows the distinction between doing things for
himself and doing it for the Lord, who knows what's to be done and what not,
who knows the fear of consequences and being free of such fear, who knows
activities that bind us from activities that free us - the intentions of such a
person are in the quality of sattva'.

[tyAgI] A
person who lets go in this way [sattva samAviShTa:] enters the quality of sattva, [mEdhAvI] gains intelligence [Chinna samshaya:] and loses all doubt.
		</text>
		<text> [na dvEShTi] He does not loath [akushalam karma] work that makes him unhappy, [na
anuShajjatE] neither does he cling [kushalE] to happiness.
		</text>
		<text>



In this way, being in the quality of sattva, a person gains intelligence - the knowledge of
things in their true form.
		</text>
		<text> With this, he loses all doubt.
		</text>
		<text> This person lets all
attachment go, along with their outcomes and the misconception of making things
happen.
		</text>
		<text> 

He doesn't loathe the idea of doing work
that makes him unhappy - work that has undesired effects.
		</text>
		<text> He also doesn't cling
to work that makes him happy - work that has desirable outcomes such as
comfort, progeny and prosperity.
		</text>
		<text>

He isn't possessive about his actions in
any way.
		</text>
		<text> In this manner, he has let go of all outcomes - other than the outcome
of achieving the Lord.
		</text>
		<text> Hence, he doesn't have likes and dislikes towards his
work.
		</text>
		<text> The misfortune of encountering an undesirable effect comes from our flaws
- it's unintentional and comes from ignorance.
		</text>
		<text>

It is said in [kaThOpanishat], 1-2-23: 'This knowledge is not achieved by people who are
restless, not by those who conduct misdeeds, not by those who are not at peace,
who do not apply themselves, even though they may try by learning a great
deal'.
		</text>
		<text> 

The statement here, is that misdeeds and
instability are opposed to the growth of knowledge.
		</text>
		<text>

In this way, 'letting go' is about giving
up attachment to actions, their outcomes and giving up the sense of 'I made it
happen'.
		</text>
		<text> This is meant by the word [tyAga] in the scriptures - it's not about giving up all forms of actions.
		</text>
		<text>
The Lord elaborates this next:

[hi] Indeed, [na shakyam] it's not possible [dEhabhr'tA] for a person having a body [tyaktum] to give up [karmANi ashEShata:] all actions without
exception.
		</text>
		<text> [tu] On the other
hand, [ya:] a person who [tyAgi] leaves [karma
phala] the outcome of his action [abhidhIyatE iti] is known as [sa tyAgI] the one who has let-go.
		</text>
		<text>



A person having a body is held and
sustained in that body.
		</text>
		<text> Indeed, it's impossible for this person to give up all
actions and do nothing.
		</text>
		<text> Actions such as eating and drinking are unavoidable in
sustaining the body - along with other actions associated with them.
		</text>
		<text> 

Great activities such as worship are
inevitable for sustenance.
		</text>
		<text> In the midst of all this, a person who leaves the
outcome of these actions is known as the one who has let-go.
		</text>
		<text> As stated in the
scriptures such as [mahAnArAyaNa], 10-5: 'Only by letting go, a person gains freedom from the cycle
of death'.
		</text>
		<text> 

In this way, the word [tyAgI] in the scriptures refers to the
person who has let-go of outcomes.
		</text>
		<text> This 'letting go' is about letting outcomes
go, along with the attachment towards the action itself and the misconception
of making things happen.
		</text>
		<text> Those are the three ways mentioned in Chap.18#4, which
started with: 'Letting-go is mentioned in three ways.
		</text>
		<text>.
		</text>
		<text>.
		</text>
		<text>'

Isn't activity designed
to give outcomes, which we are bound to?

However, the scriptures also mention
outcomes for routine and prescribed actions.
		</text>
		<text> For example, many forms of worship
are said to yield a superior life.
		</text>
		<text> In the [mahAnArAyaNa] 1-6-39, it is said - 'A family man will enter the abode of Brahma,
the prime engineer of the universe'.
		</text>
		<text> 

Such actions are described in terms of
their links to specific outcomes.
		</text>
		<text> These statements seem to indicate that
actions are conceived to achieve certain outcomes by their very nature.
		</text>
		<text> Just as
a seed causes a tree to come into being, these actions bring desired and
undesired outcomes, inevitably causing attachments.
		</text>
		<text> 

Attachments go against the achievement of liberty.
		</text>
		<text> Hence, shouldn't a person who desires only Moksha desist from these prescribed actions? The Lord
answers that question next -

[karmaNa: phalam] The outcome of actions [prEtya bhavati] will happen [trividham] in three ways [atyAginAm] to those who haven't let-go: [aniShTam] undesirable, [iShTam] desirable [cha
mishram] and a mix of both.
		</text>
		<text> [tu] However, [na kvachit] none of these happen [saMnyAsinAm] to those who have let-go.
		</text>
		<text>



Undesirable outcomes torture us.
		</text>
		<text> Desirable
outcomes reward us.
		</text>
		<text> Other outcomes such as wealth, food or a family come with a
mix of both desirable and undesirable moments.
		</text>
		<text> 

These three types of outcomes happen to
people who haven't let-go of possessiveness towards their actions, to people
who haven't let-go of outcomes and the misconception that they make things
happen.
		</text>
		<text> These outcomes happen to them after they have committed the action - in
this life or in succeeding ones.
		</text>
		<text>

However, none of these happen to those who
have let-go: There is indeed no outcome that stands in the way of achieving Moksha for those who have let the three types of outcomes
go.
		</text>
		<text> 

Just as worship can be done every day to
deserve things needed for our livelihood and our desires, it can be done to
deserve Moksha as well.
		</text>
		<text> This is the distinction asserted
over here.
		</text>
		<text> 

Working to earn Moksha
is illustrated in [br'hadArAnyaka upanishat], 4-4-22: 'People who pursue the Lord wish to know Him through the
statements in the Vedas, through worship, charity, discipline and by
controlling their hunger'.
		</text>
		<text>

This practice of 'letting go' of the
outcome of the actions we do, 'letting go' of possessiveness towards them and
the misconception that we're the ones who make things happen - this 'letting
go' is the same as the term 'renunciation' mentioned in the scriptures.
		</text>
		<text>

Next, the Lord describes the method to stay
free of the misconception that we're the ones who make things happen - By
placing doer-ship in the Lord, who is supreme and is present as the Self
inside.
		</text>
		<text> In this way a person lets possessiveness go, even in actions that are
associated with clear outcomes.
		</text>
		<text> 

When we do something, it's the Lord Himself
initiating activities with the Self that belongs to Him, with a body and organs
that belong to Him, with His breath, for the purpose of His amusement.
		</text>
		<text> 

For example, the experience of satisfying
our hunger is an outcome of actions like earning and eating.
		</text>
		<text> The outcomes that
are experienced by the Self, along with the actions that achieve it, belong to
the Lord Himself.

[mahAbAhO]
Arjuna, [nibOdha] hear and know
[EtAni] these [pancha] five [kAraNAni] causes [siddhayE]
for the achievement [sarvakarmaNAm] of all actions [mE]
from Me.
		</text>
		<text> [prOktAni] They are
specified [sAMkhyE kr'tAntE] in
the reflections of the Upanishads.
		</text>
		<text>



'Reflections' come from intelligence and
understanding.
		</text>
		<text> The 'reflections of the Upanishads' refer to the intelligence
built by understanding the concepts in the Upanishads in their true form.
		</text>
		<text> 

If we aren't the reason
for outcomes, what causes things to happen?

In this Shloka, The Lord says - Hear and know
the five causes of achievement from Me.
		</text>
		<text> 'Achieving an action' is about
initiating it.
		</text>
		<text> The five causes come from the understanding put together by the
intelligence derived from the Upanishads.
		</text>
		<text> Put them into place in My presence.
		</text>
		<text>

The intelligence derived from the
Upanishads says that the body, its organs, its breath and the Self are
instruments of the Lord - The Lord uses them to make things happen, as stated
in scriptures such as [br'hadArAnyaka], 3-7-22: 'The One who sits inside the Self, is distinct from the
Self, whom the Self doesn't know, to whom the Self is the body, who controls
the Self from the inside - He regulates you and is the Self in yourself.
		</text>
		<text> He is
ever-lasting'.
		</text>
		<text> Also said in [yajurAraNyaka], 3-11-2: 'The One who is the Self to every Self, ruling by entering
inside'.

Next, the Lord enumerates the five causes:

[adhiShThAnam] The base, [tathA kartA] along with the doer, [cha] together with [pr'thak vidham] the different [karaNam] organs [cha] and [vividhA pr'thak] the various [chEShTA] activities - [atra] in this field, [panchamam] the fifth one [daivam] is The Divine.
		</text>
		<text>

[panchaitE hEtava: tasya] They are the five causes of [yat karma] any action [nara: prArabhtE] that a human can initiate [sharIra] with the body, [vAk] speech, [manObhi:]
or the mind - [vA nyayyam]
whether just [vA viparItam] or
unjust.
		</text>
		<text>



There are five causes of just or unjust actions.
		</text>
		<text>
Actions are 'just' when they are recommended in the scriptures and 'unjust'
when they are forbidden.
		</text>
		<text> These actions are done by the body, done in speech or
in the mind.
		</text>
		<text> The five causes of action are:

The base:
The body is the base from which activities are carried out.
		</text>
		<text> It's a combination
of the elements of nature.
		</text>
		<text> It is the abode of the Self.
		</text>
		<text>

The doer:
The Self is the doer, whose 'knower-ship' and 'doer-ship' are mentioned in the
scriptures: [vEdAnta sutra],
2-3-19 says 'It is the one that knows'; [vEdAnta sutra], 2-3-33 says 'It is to be considered as the doer for the scriptures
to have meaning'

The different organs: These are the organs of action.
		</text>
		<text> The organ of speech, the arms,
legs, the excretory organs along the organ of thought form the five organs of
action.
		</text>
		<text> They perform different functions whenever we do something.
		</text>
		<text>

The various activities: The word 'activity' here refers to the gases in our body and the
activities that happen inside, such as respiration.
		</text>
		<text>

The Divine:
In the field where things are combined into actions, the fifth one is The
Divine - It is the Lord who is inside everything, the main cause in bringing
actions to effect.
		</text>
		<text> As said in Chap.15#15: 'I am at the heart of everything' and
in Chap.18#61: 'Arjuna, the Supreme Lord sits at the heart of every being,
spinning all beings, mounting them in the mechanism of the environment'.
		</text>
		<text> 

The 'doer-ship' of the Self is completely
dependent on the Lord, as said in [vEdAnta sutra], 2-3-40: 'as said in the scriptures, the doer-ship is given by the
Supreme Lord'.
		</text>
		<text>

Whatever the Self does is completely
dependent on the Lord.
		</text>
		<text> Given this fact, all instructions in the scriptures and
everything they forbid would be meaningless if we consider that the Self is not
accountable for any action.
		</text>
		<text> Vyasa has resolved this dilemma as well, in [vEdAnta sutra], 2-3-41: 'The Lord expects
the Self to begin the attempt, so that His instructions in the scriptures
retain their use'.
		</text>
		<text>

In summary: Actions are carried out with
organs given by the Lord, having the Lord as the basis, with the strength
that's deposited in them by the Lord.
		</text>
		<text> The Self has the Lord as the basis of
existence as well, with its strength given by the Lord Himself.
		</text>
		<text> 

The Self initiates its attempt to carry out
an action according to its will, as per the configuration of its body and
associated organs.
		</text>
		<text> After that, The Lord inside grants permission to commence
the action and sets the Self in motion.
		</text>
		<text> In this way, the Self becomes the cause
of action as well - by its intent alone.
		</text>
		<text>

This is similar to activities that require
many people and equipment - for example, activities that result in moving a
huge boulder or building a bridge.
		</text>
		<text> In such activities, many people and machines
are considered to be the cause, with each of them having their do's and don'ts.
		</text>
		<text>
In the same way, this Shloka described the activity brought about by the Self
and the Lord.

As explained in the previous Shloka, the

		<text> Despite this, a person who

against reality.

[yasya] The
person whose [bhAva:] belief [nAhaMkr'tO] is that he's not the one who
makes things happen, [yasya]
the one whose [buddhi:]
intellect [na lipyatE] stays
free of the burden of attachments [na nibadhyatE] and doesn't get trapped - [sa: hatvApi] Even when he kills [imAn lOkAn] all these people, [na hanti] he doesn't kill.
		</text>
		<text>



Any performance has The Lord as its basis.
		</text>
		<text>
With such conviction, this person has resolved - 'I am not the one who makes it
happen'.
		</text>
		<text> He is distinguished by this resolution, not giving himself any
self-importance - he doesn't have the belief that he makes things happen.
		</text>
		<text>

His intellect stays free - his conviction
is: 'In these actions, I don't make things happen, that's how these outcomes
don't relate to me'.
		</text>
		<text> The idea that says 'This work is mine' is not born in his
thoughts.
		</text>
		<text>

Even when he kills all these people in war
- including Bhishma and Drona - he doesn't kill them.
		</text>
		<text> The action called war
doesn't stick to him.
		</text>
		<text> Meaning, he doesn't suffer its consequences.
		</text>
		<text>

Only a predominance of sattva
brings the conviction that you don't make things happen.
		</text>
		<text> It keeps you away from
possessiveness towards the action and its outcome.
		</text>
		<text> 

Next, to remind us about the admirable
nature of the quality of sattva, The Lord describes the
differences in various actions brought about by the three qualities, starting with the way in
which actions are instigated.

[jnAnam]
Knowledge, [jnEyam] that which
has to be perceived [parijnAtA]
and the one who recognizes [trividhA] are the three [karma chOdana] sources of initiative for any action.
		</text>
		<text> [karaNam] The instruments, [karma] the activity itself [kartA] and the one who performs the activity [iti trvidha:] are the three types of [karma saMgraha:] things that put together the action.
		</text>
		<text>



This Shloka describes the three sources of
action: 'knowledge' is to be aware of the work that needs to be done.
		</text>
		<text> 'That
which has to be perceived' is the goal of the action - what we experience from
the action.
		</text>
		<text> 'The one who recognizes' is the one who perceives.
		</text>
		<text>

In any action, these three sources come
together - The performance of every action is associated with the knowledge
required to do it, the perception to be gained from it and the one who
perceives.
		</text>
		<text> 

In this world, the activities and the
resulting perceptions happen in the trio of the means, the activity and the
doer: The 'means of an activity' are the instruments required for the activity.
		</text>
		<text>
The activity is the sequence of what is done.
		</text>
		<text> The doer is the one who
accomplishes the action.

Even in this huge variety, there is something
called The Self inside each being.

		</text>
		<text> 

Whether someone is a teacher, tall, short

subject to any such variety.
		</text>
		<text> It is unchanging - characteristics such as being a
teacher are temporary and will wear out in time, along with our body.

Yet another type of awareness leads to
preoccupation in some isolated work, believing in various processes and rituals
to deliver results that have very poor value - thinking that it will yield
whatever is required.
		</text>
		<text> 

Since the result is insignificant, there is
no basis for this attachment.

previous case, it doesn't recognize the concept of the Self being distinct from
the body.

[yat kr'tam] that's carried out
[niyatam] with self-governance,
[saMga rahitam] free from
attachment, [arAga dvEShata:]
without desire or hatred [aphala prEpsunA] by a person who is not driven by the outcome - [tat] such action [uchyatE] is said to be [sAtvikam] in the quality of sattva.
		</text>
		<text>



Our intention leads to activity.
		</text>
		<text>

'Self-governance' is about performing
according to our role in society and our stage in life.
		</text>
		<text>

Being 'free from attachment' is to let go
of possessiveness towards our activity, along with their outcomes and the
misconception of making things happen.
		</text>
		<text>

Performing without desire or hatred - This
is about performing without being driven by the craving for credit, or the
aversion towards discredit.
		</text>
		<text> It's about performance without hypocrisy.
		</text>
		<text>

'Not being driven by the outcome' is to
avoid keeping the outcome as our purpose.
		</text>
		<text> It's about avoiding attachment to the
outcome.
		</text>
		<text>

Activity that's performed in this manner,
with just the simple attitude that 'It needs to be done' is said to be in the
quality of sattva.

When work is driven by expectation, the

Let's

We 'perceive' by putting together
stimuli that are sensed by our organs.
		</text>
		<text> For instance, when something is sharp
and looks shiny, we are convinced that it's a metal knife.
		</text>
		<text> Our intellect gives
that conviction.
		</text>
		<text> 

Irrespective of what our intellect says,
we can still choose our path.
		</text>
		<text> That choice is our Resolve.
		</text>
		<text>

'Intellect' is the intelligence that
enables us to discern - to perceive clearly.
		</text>
		<text> It reflects as the conviction that
happens prior to perception.
		</text>
		<text>

'Resolve' is about being steadfast and
maintaining our course, even in the face of adversity.

Intellect and Resolve have three distinct
forms each, going by the three qualities of sattva, rajas and tamas.

		<text> When the intellect is in the
quality of sattva, it knows them as they are.
		</text>
		<text> 

A person's profession, along with the time,
place and stage of his life determine his activities to achieve prosperity and
liberation.
		</text>
		<text> This intellect knows the activities that are prescribed and
forbidden.
		</text>
		<text> 

Being in sattva, this
intellect knows the fear that comes from going against the scriptures and the
freedom from fear that comes from complying with them.

		<text> 

It knows the character of this world and
the cycle of bondage it brings.

		<text> It also knows 'liberty' as the exit from this
cycle.

With the intellect

Even while focusing on prosperity or

		<text> [prasAdajam] It generates the serenity of [Atma buddhi] the intellect that pursues the
Self.
		</text>
		<text>



At the beginning, while initiating focus,
the activity is intense and is very strenuous.
		</text>
		<text> 

Without the exclusive experience of the
Self, it seems as painful as poison.
		</text>
		<text> It then ripens into bliss - with the power
of repetition, it ripens to manifest as the unique and blissful experience of
the Self.
		</text>
		<text>

That bliss generates the serenity of the
intellect that pursues the Self.
		</text>
		<text> This intellect works to comprehend the Self.
		</text>
		<text>
Serenity is about the intellect being free of all other subjects.
		</text>
		<text> 

When intentions are free from all other
subjects, happiness is born.
		</text>
		<text> This happiness comes from the exclusive experience
of the Self in all its characteristics.

[yat sukham] Then
there's happiness that [Atmana:] makes one [mOhanam]
confounded [agrE] at the start [cha] and [anubandhE] when it yields the outcome [cha] too.

		<text> [uttham] It
brings forth [nidrA] drowsiness,
[Alasya] laziness [pramAda] and negligence.
		</text>
		<text> [tat] Such happiness [udAhr'tam] is said to be [tAmasam] in tamas.
		</text>
		<text>



Happiness that's in tamas
infatuates and ends up confounding us.
		</text>
		<text> It does this while experiencing the
action, and also at the time of yielding outcomes.
		</text>
		<text> 

Here, the word 'confounded' is used to
refer to a state where things are not perceived as they are.
		</text>
		<text> This type of
happiness is generated by drowsiness, laziness and negligence.
		</text>
		<text> They confound us
even as we experience the action.
		</text>
		<text> 

Drowsiness brings down our ability to
recognize things around us - this is easily evident in our lives.
		</text>
		<text> 

Laziness is the lethargy seen in our limbs
when it comes to doing something.
		</text>
		<text> 

Lethargy in awareness will happen in a body
with lethargic limbs.
		</text>
		<text> 

Negligence is the lack of attention while
doing our work.
		</text>
		<text> It fosters lethargy in awareness as well.
		</text>
		<text> In this way, lethargy
and negligence confound us, along with drowsiness.
		</text>
		<text> 

The happiness coming from this intoxication
is said to be in tamas.
		</text>
		<text>

Hence, a person who desires Moksha must overcome rajas and tamas, placing himself in sattva alone.

No creature is free from the three qualities of nature - be it a human on this
earth, be it any power, any entity in this universe right from Brahma, the
principal engineer down to vegetables and other immobile objects.
		</text>
		<text>

This is the material
world - it is full of the three qualities.
		</text>
		<text>
Nurture sattva and adore the Lord.
		</text>
		<text>

The scriptures explain the pursuit of
freedom from the three qualities -
'Achievement of freedom is about letting go.
		</text>
		<text> It's not
about work, family or wealth.
		</text>
		<text> The concept of letting go
was described as the way to achieve freedom in the form of Moksha.
		</text>
		<text>
It's no different from renunciation.
		</text>
		<text> 

It's about leaving of the misconception
that we're the doers; leaving the illusion that we make things happen with our work.
		</text>
		<text>
With this, we leave our attachment towards the outcome of our action.
		</text>
		<text> We also
leave out possessiveness in our actions.
		</text>
		<text> 

We let-go by placing the Lord as the doer
and ourselves as the instrument.
		</text>
		<text> All of this happens by growing the sattva within us.
		</text>
		<text> 

By bringing in the three qualities, The Lord reiterated that
sattva needs to be nurtured.
		</text>
		<text>

Next, The Lord describes that 'working towards
liberty' matures in the form of 'adoration towards The Lord'.
		</text>
		<text>
To describe the work that leads to Moksha, He describes our
duties.

		<text> These duties are to be done according to our profession in this world.

		<text> Our
eligibility is categorized by the three qualities.

[pravibhaktAni] are classified [guNai:] as per the qualities [svabhAva prabhavai:] that come from their
inherent nature.
		</text>
		<text>



We have
committed deeds since beginning-less time.
		</text>
		<text> These deeds have resulted in our
birth in the current form.
		</text>
		<text> The influence of these deeds gives the essence of
our body, in the form of three qualities - sattva, rajas and tamas.
		</text>
		<text> 

Our inherent nature is 'inherited' from a
combination of these qualities.
		</text>
		<text>

In this way, the inherent nature of
philosophers, administrators and traders comes from the influence of the deeds
they have committed since beginning-less time.
		</text>
		<text>

The inherent nature of a philosopher brings
forth the quality of sattva and subdues the qualities of rajas and tamas.
		</text>
		<text> 

The inherent nature of an administrator
overpowers the qualities of tamas and sattva,
bringing the quality of rajas forward.
		</text>
		<text> 

A trader's inherent nature subdues the
qualities of sattva and rajas,
giving a slight upper-hand to the quality of tamas.
		</text>
		<text> 

On the other hand, those who merely assist
have an inherent nature that subdues the qualities of rajas
and sattva, leaving a dominant quality of tamas.
		</text>
		<text>

The activities in the scriptures are classified
according to the qualities in our inherent nature.

activities [svabhAvajam] born

'Tranquility' is the quite-ness in our
organs that deal with the environment.
		</text>

'Restraint' is to control ourselves
internally.

'Focus' is toil in the form of establishing
control over our urge to enjoy, as established in the scriptures.
		</text>
		<text> 

'Cleanliness' is the qualification to
perform the work prescribed in the scriptures.
		</text>
		<text>

'Composure' is when our intentions aren't
deformed, even when troubled by others.
		</text>
		<text> 

'Being straight' is about reflecting our
thoughts in our action and our outlook.
		</text>
		<text> 

'Knowledge' is to know what's superior and
what's not, in authenticity.
		</text>
		<text>

'Wisdom' is to know and distinguish what's
superior in its uniqueness.
		</text>
		<text> 

'Conviction' is the strong belief in
everything we've learnt, unshakable by any means.
		</text>
		<text> The pinnacle of learning is
to know The Lord as the supreme person, the One in whom everything resides, the
One who resides in everything.
		</text>
		<text> 

He is known as 'Para Brahma', devoid of any
hint of defect.
		</text>
		<text> By nature, He is the aggregate of unbroken, unlimited amounts
of knowledge, strength and an infinite number of favorable qualities.
		</text>
		<text> 

He is the entity that has to be known by
all knowledge.
		</text>
		<text> He alone is the single cause of the entire universe and the basis
for its existence.
		</text>
		<text> 

He is the one who makes everything happen.
		</text>
		<text>
All forms of knowledge and activities are ways to adore and worship Him.
		</text>
		<text> 

Conviction is to be certain about the truth
- that the Lord, being adored by actions, gives the outcomes of righteousness,
material wealth, desires and liberty.
		</text>
		<text> 

It's said in the Gita itself:

Chap.15#15: 'I alone am to be known from
all the Vedas'

Chap.10#8: 'People with this knowledge
worship Me with the conviction that I am the origin of everything; Every entity
gets stimulated with the initiative given by Me'

Chap.7#7: 'Just as beads are strung on a
string, all of this is mounted in Me'

Chap.5#29: 'A person attains peace by
knowing me, the enjoyer of worship and prayer, the Lord of all the worlds, a
friend and ally of all beings'

Chap.7#7: 'there is absolutely nothing else
that is superior to Me'

Chap.18#46: The Lord, by whom all this is
pervaded, from whom all beings get their ability to commence action.
		</text>
		<text>

Chap.10#3: 'the person who is free from
misconceptions knows Me without birth and without an origin, the Lord of the
universe.
		</text>
		<text>

This is conviction.
		</text>
		<text> A philosopher's
inherent nature brings out all these activities.

professions and duties are laid out in the scriptures.
		</text>
		<text> Their listing is merely
illustrative.
		</text>
		<text>

Activities such as the worship of the Lord
are common to all groups of people.
		</text>
		<text> Activities such as the practice of
tranquility are common to those who desire liberation.
		</text>
		<text>

The quality of sattva
is predominant in a philosopher.
		</text>
		<text> Due to this, the activities of tranquility and
restraint happen naturally, with ease.
		</text>
		<text> These activities are said to come from
innate character.
		</text>
		<text>

In administrators and traders, rajas and tamas are predominant.
		</text>
		<text> For
them, activities such as tranquility and restraint are tough to practice -
these activities aren't known to be in their innate character.
		</text>
		<text>

The occupation of a philosopher is to
worship, and carry out worship on behalf of someone else; It is also to teach
and accept offerings.
		</text>
		<text> The occupation of an administrator is to take care of
society.
		</text>
		<text> That of a trader is to invest, as mentioned before.
		</text>
		<text> The duty and
occupation of an assistant is to assist in the occupation of the other three.

[mAnava:] Any
human being [vindati] attains [siddhim] the goal [abhyarchya] by worshipping [tam] Him [svakarmaNA]
with his own work - [yEna] He,
by whom [sarvam idam] all this [tatam] is pervaded, [yata:] from whom [bhUtAnAm] all beings get [pravr'tti:] their ability to commence action.
		</text>
		<text>



'By whom all this is pervaded, from where
all beings get their ability to commence action right from birth' - He is The
Lord.
		</text>
		<text> 

He says 'I am the One who is situated in
this way.
		</text>
		<text> I sit as the essence of every power.
		</text>
		<text> A human being worships Me in
this manner, with his own work.
		</text>
		<text> Such a person pleases Me and attains the goal
of achieving Me.
		</text>
		<text> As I said before, everything comes from Me and everything is
pervaded by Me'.
		</text>
		<text>

As said in Chap.7#6 and Chap.7#7: I am the
creator and the destroyer of the entire universe.
		</text>
		<text> There is absolutely nothing
else that is superior to Me.
		</text>
		<text>

Chap.9#4: This whole world is pervaded by
Me, while My form is not perceptible.
		</text>
		<text>

Chap.9#10: The material environment
manifests as this world, with all its stationary and mobile beings according to
My will.
		</text>
		<text> I am the supreme controller.
		</text>
		<text> 

Chap.10#8: I am the origin of everything; Every
entity gets stimulated with the initiative given by Me.
		</text>
		<text>

- In all these places in the Gita, The Lord
has described Himself as the One who is to be worshipped by all actions.

[svadharmO]
Your own work, [viguNa:]
perhaps lacking in perfection, [shrEyAn] is superior [paradharmAt] in comparison to work that's not yours, [su
anuShThitAt] even when executed with excellence.
		</text>
		<text>



When you work as described before - by leaving possessiveness, outcomes and the
misconception of making things happen - it takes the form of My worship.
		</text>
		<text> The
phrase 'your own work' is the work that can be initiated by you, in your present
space.
		</text>
		<text>

'your own work' means your initiative - not
what you or others think you should be doing.
		</text>
		<text>

Work that's performed in this manner takes
the form of [karmayOga].
		</text>
		<text>
It is activity done using your organs and is achievable by all of us, though we
are constantly constrained in our environment.
		</text>
		<text>

Thus, your own work done in this manner,
called [karmayOga],
even perhaps lacking in perfection, is superior in comparison to [jnAnayOga],
which is to be done by people who are experts in keeping their organs under
control.
		</text>
		<text> 

The practice of jnAnayOga
is about having control over all of our organs.
		</text>
		<text> It's loaded with the
possibility of mistakes due to carelessness.
		</text>
		<text> 

Hence, the practice of activity
without attachment, even when imperfect, is superior to the rare, onetime
achievement of perfect control over all organs.
		</text>
		<text>

The Lord elaborates this 'activity
without attachment' again -

[kurvan] By
doing [karma] work [svabhAva niyatam] according to his nature, [na Apnoti] a person doesn't obtain [kilbiSham] any guilt or fault.
		</text>
		<text>



A person inside this environment is
constantly doing.
		</text>
		<text> 

Work comes naturally to all of us, since
our organs are always transacting with the environment - this is what they are
meant for, by their very nature.
		</text>
		<text> By working, a person doesn't obtain any guilt
or fault - he doesn't get tied down in this world.
		</text>
		<text> The work done has no flaws.
		</text>
		<text> 

On the other hand, the
exclusive pursuit of knowledge is achieved by controlling all our organs.
		</text>
		<text>
Such control is difficult and prone to flaws.
		</text>
		<text> A person who dedicates himself to
contemplation incurs guilt due to imperfect control.
		</text>
		<text> It ties him down in this
world.
		</text>
		<text>

Hence, activity without
attachment is indeed superior.
		</text>
		<text> The Lord recalls His statements in the third
chapter:

enveloped by smoke.
		</text>

Arjuna, [sahajam karma] the
natural state of activity [na tyajEt] must not be abandoned, [api] even though [sadOSham] it comes with its drawbacks.
		</text>
		<text>



Activity is innate.
		</text>
		<text> Activities are easily
achievable and don't carry mistakes.
		</text>
		<text> They must not be abandoned, even though
they may come with drawbacks in the form of sorrow and hardship.
		</text>
		<text> 

Just as fire is enveloped by smoke, all initiatives
are surrounded by drawbacks - be they initiatives to achieve actions or to
achieve knowledge.
		</text>
		<text>

Even when a person is able to contemplate
on the Self exclusively, he needs to work without
attachment.
		</text>
		<text> The distinction made here is: Working without
attachment is easy and doesn't carry any mistakes.
		</text>
		<text> On the other hand, the
exclusive contemplation of the Self, practiced by giving up worldly activity
is the opposite - it is tough and prone to fault.

A person conquers his own mind by being

This person loses possessiveness and the
illusion of making things happen, by having the conviction that the Lord is the
One who makes things happen.

Endowed with renunciation and the
conviction that it's all about letting go, this
person works and attains the ultimate goal of being free
from the effects of action.

intense meditation and the exclusive contemplation of the Self.

By worshipping the Lord
with our actions, we let go.

Calmness in the actions of our body comes

With a clean intellect, the Self is seen in

A person with such intellect controls his
mind with resolve - he doesn't mind
turning away from his preoccupation with the stimuli of this world.

		<text> In this
way, his mind is capable of focus.
		</text>
		<text> He lets go of stimuli - sound, touch,
sights, taste and smell - by pushing them away.

		<text> 

He abandons the emotions of desire and
hatred that are driven by such stimuli.

		<text> 

He practices solitude - he stays in a space
that's free from all impediments to his focus.
		</text>
		<text> 

He eats within limits, neither too much nor
too little.

His speech, temperament and mind are
disciplined by focus.

		<text> Always intent on his focus, he keeps to the practice till
he departs from his body.

		<text> He takes recourse to shunning his desires by
rejecting anything that's not his focus, enhancing his detachment with every
opportunity.

Casting aside the notion that the body is
the Self, he leaves behind the force of past deeds that cause such a notion.
		</text>
		<text> He
leaves behind the arrogance that comes from such a notion, along with desire,
anger and the tendency to grab material items.

He is without possessiveness towards
objects that don't belong to him.

		<text> He is peaceful, content in the experience of
the Self alone.

In this way, performing with focus and

Having realized the Self, [prasannAtmA] with a serene mind, [Na shOchati] he doesn't get upset [na kAMkShati] and doesn't yearn.

		</text>
		<text> [labhatE] He attains [param madbhaktim] the ultimate devotion to Me.
		</text>
		<text>



'Realizing the Self' is about uncovering
the true nature of the Self.
		</text>
		<text> 

By its very nature, the Self is pure,
limitless expanse of knowledge.
		</text>
		<text> It exists for the Lord's purpose - that is its
sole characteristic.
		</text>
		<text> The Lord explained the fact that the Self belongs to Him
in Chap.7#5: 'Know My ultimate nature - the Self, which is distinct in the form
of a conscious being'

Having realized the Self, a person is
endowed with a serene mind.
		</text>
		<text> 

The Lord describes a serene mind: 'It is
un-stained by anguish or activity.
		</text>
		<text> It isn't bothered about anything other than
Me.
		</text>
		<text> He doesn't yearn for anything - In fact, such a person is indifferent to
all distinctions among beings other than Me.
		</text>
		<text> 

That's why such a person has an even
outlook.
		</text>
		<text> He considers all materials in this world to be insignificant'.
		</text>
		<text> 

With this worship, we
gain limitless love for the Lord.
		</text>
		<text>

The Lord continues to describe His
relationship: 'Such a person achieves ultimate devotion to Me - This person
sees Me as the Supreme Lord, running the activities of creation, sustenance and
destruction as My sport.
		</text>
		<text> 

I repel everything that's undesirable.
		</text>
		<text> I am
the harmony of unbroken, unlimited, infinite number of fortunate qualities.
		</text>
		<text> He
experiences ultimate devotion towards Me in the form of excessive adoration.
		</text>
		<text> I
am his owner, the inexhaustible sea of beauty and attractiveness, having lotus
eyes, always in the company of Lakshmi'.

such devotion -

With devotion,
this person knows Me in essence - who I am, along with My form, My characteristics,
all My qualities and My powers.
		</text>
		<text> Knowing Me in this way through devotion, he enters Me without delay.
		</text>
		<text> 

In short - A person enters the Lord the
moment he recognizes the Lord in His true form, with devotion.
		</text>
		<text>


Unbroken, unbounded devotion
comes by knowing My essence along with My form and characteristics, seeing My
qualities and My powers.
		</text>
		<text> With this devotion, he
achieves Me - that's what is meant here.
		</text>
		<text> 

This Shloka re-stated that achieving the
Lord comes through such devotion.
		</text>
		<text> This was stated
in Chap.11#54: 'Only by single-minded devotion, it
is possible to know Me as I am, to see Me and to be one with Me'.
		</text>
		<text> 

In this way, devotion
alone makes it possible to enter the Lord in His essence.
		</text>
		<text>

Up until now, the performance of routine
and prescribed actions was emphasized.
		</text>
		<text> When we leave our attachment towards
their outcomes, we leave possessiveness and the misconception that we make
things happen.
		</text>
		<text> 

When free of these misconceptions, our
activity is a method to worship the Lord.
		</text>
		<text> These activities mature into devotion and we enter the Lord - that was also
described.
		</text>
		<text>

Next, The Lord states that even when
actions driven by desire are performed as described, they mature in the same
way -

That means - you would be knocked off My

[kauntEya]
Arjuna, [nibaddha:] being tired
down [svEna karmaNA] by your
own actions [svabhAvajEna] born
out of inherent nature, [avasha:
kariShyasi] you will unwittingly do [tat api] that very activity, [yat] which [nEchChasi] you don't wish [kartum] to do [mOhAt] due
to ignorance.
		</text>
		<text>



Valiant confrontation is the activity that
flows from the inherent nature of a warrior.
		</text>
		<text> You
are bound by this valor, since it comes from your inherent nature.
		</text>
		<text> 

You wouldn't be able to exercise your free
will, being tied down by such bonds.
		</text>
		<text> When others rub it in, you wouldn't be
able to tolerate their insult.
		</text>
		<text> In this way you will end up fighting the very
war you wanted to avoid - due to the opinions you formed out of ignorance.
		</text>
		<text>

All species are governed by Me, the Supreme
Lord, to comply with the environment according to their past deeds.

[arjuna]
Arjuna, [Ishvara:] the Supreme
Lord [tiShThati] sits [hr'ddEshE] at the heart [sarva bhUtAnAm] of every being, [bhrAmayan] spinning [sarva bhUtAni] all beings, [yantrArUDhAni] mounting them in the
mechanism [mAyayA] of the
environment.
		</text>
		<text>



The Supreme Lord controls everything by His
very nature.
		</text>
		<text> He is Lord Krishna.
		</text>
		<text> He is at the heart of every being - Knowledge
and consciousness arise at the place where He is situated, the source of
activity and control.
		</text>
		<text> 

In what way is He situated in there? What
does He do there? 

He sits there, spinning all beings by mounting
them in the mechanism of the environment.
		</text>
		<text> 

Meaning - The Lord Himself has established
the mechanism of our body and its organs.
		</text>
		<text> All beings are mounted in such a
mechanism, made from what we call the environment.
		</text>
		<text> 

The Lord stays at the heart of all beings
and keeps them going according to their qualities, using the experiences
created by sattva, rajas and tamas.
		</text>
		<text> These qualities are in the environment.
		</text>
		<text> This
environment belongs to the Lord Himself.
		</text>
		<text>

As said before in Chap.15#15: 'I am at the
heart of everything.
		</text>
		<text> Knowledge, memory and the ability to reason come from Me',
in Chap.10#8: 'Every entity gets stimulated and initiates action by Me' and in
scriptures such as [br'hadArAnyaka], 3.7.22: 'The One who is situated in the Self'.
		</text>
		<text>

Now, The Lord describes the means to
achieve freedom from these experiences.

[bhArata]
Arjuna, [sharaNam gachCha] take
refuge [tam Eva] in Him alone -
[sarva bhAvEna] in every way,
with all your heart.
		</text>
		<text> [prApsyasi] You shall attain [shAntim] contentment [shAshvatam sthAnam] and the position of eternity [tat prasAdAt] by His benevolence.
		</text>
		<text>



Things are the way they are, due to the Supreme
Lord.
		</text>
		<text> Hence, approach Him alone.
		</text>
		<text> 

The Supreme Lord controls everything and
has tender affection towards those who have taken refuge in Him.
		</text>
		<text> Due to that
affection, He takes on the role of the charioteer and instructs you.
		</text>
		<text> 

Take refuge in Him with all your heart -
follow Him wholeheartedly.
		</text>
		<text> Otherwise, you will remain ignorant of His reality
and will remain driven by your experience of this environment, which is created
by the Lord Himself.
		</text>
		<text> 

Even then you will not be able to avoid
activities such as this war.
		</text>
		<text> Acting in this manner would destroy you.
		</text>
		<text> 

Hence, do your activities, including the
activity of war, as instructed by
the Lord.
		</text>
		<text> Working in this way, you shall achieve ultimate contentment by His
benevolence.
		</text>
		<text> 'Ultimate contentment' is relief from all past deeds.
		</text>
		<text> 

You will then attain the position of
eternity, which has been described in many scriptures -

As in the [puruShasUkta]:
'Those who are with the Lord see the ultimate abode of Vishnu perpetually'; 

In [yajurveda], 4-7-13:
'Those who surrender to the Lord join those who are with Him in that flawless
abode since beginning-less time'; 

In [narayana],
'The eternal position isn't achieved by wealth, by offspring or by deeds.
		</text>
		<text> It is
achievable only by letting go'; 

[ChAndOgya], 3-12-7: 'The path to the ultimate abode is not known to all.
		</text>
		<text> Those who
have surrendered to the Lord attain that abode'; 

[katha], 3-9: 'That abode is beyond everything in this world, a place of supreme
brilliance.
		</text>
		<text> There is nothing superior to it'.
		</text>
		<text> 'Those who are guided by the
knowledge of the Lord keep their minds under control and reach the ultimate
abode'.

Meaning - I meditate on this supreme
person, who is the color of the sun and is beyond the darkness of ignorance.
		</text>
		<text>
Only by knowing Him, a person is free over here.
		</text>
		<text> There is no other path to The
Goal.
		</text>
		<text>

Such scriptures describe the succession of
the Lord's thoughts, using words such as 'knowing',
'meditation' and 'worship'.
		</text>
		<text> It is equivalent to seeing the Lord, is very pleasant
and is expressed by the directive 'keep Me in your mind'.
		</text>
		<text>

'Be My devotee' - The Lord directs to adore
Him without limit.
		</text>
		<text> This directive is to keep the train of His thoughts running
by means of excessive adoration.
		</text>
		<text> Such a train of thought is pleasant beyond
comparison.
		</text>
		<text>

'Take initiative to worship Me' - Adoring
the Lord with reverence is very joyful.
		</text>
		<text> Enjoy the state of being eager to
worship - to be completely occupied in service.
		</text>
		<text>

'Adore and treasure Me as superior' - Great
devotion to Me is very pleasant.
		</text>
		<text> So is the recognition that I am superior.
		</text>
		<text>
Practice such devotion.
		</text>
		<text>

The Lord warms up: Being in this way, you
shall certainly achieve Me.
		</text>
		<text> I affirm this fact to you.
		</text>
		<text> I speak the truth.
		</text>
		<text> I'm
not saying this merely to persuade you.
		</text>
		<text> That's because you are very dear to Me.
		</text>
		<text>

It was stated in Chap.7#17: 'I am dear to
this knowledgeable person, in a way that is definitely
beyond description.
		</text>
		<text> He is dear to Me as well' - I have huge adoration for the
person who adores Me a lot.
		</text>
		<text> Being unable to tolerate any separation from him, I
will ensure that he attains Me.
		</text>
		<text> 

In this way, I declare that you shall
achieve Me - this is a fact.

Surrender and let
the Lord liberate you.

aham tvA sarva pApEbhya:
mOkShayiShyAmi mA shucha: || 66 ||
		</text>
		<text>

]



This Shloka can be seen in two views.
		</text>
		<text>
The first view is -



[parityajya]
Let go of [sarva dharmAn] all uplifting
achievements and [sharaNam vraja] make your surrender [mAm Eva] to Me alone.
		</text>
		<text> [aham]
I [mOkShayiShyAmi] shall free [tvA] you [sarva
pApEbhya:] from all misfortune.
		</text>
		<text> [mA shucha:] Don't worry.
		</text>
		<text>



The second view is -



[parityajya]
Let go of [sarva dharmAn] every
regret and reparation that stands in the way of devotion
[sharaNam vraja] and surrender [mAm Eva] to Me alone.
		</text>
		<text> [aham] I [mOkShayiShyAmi] shall free [tvA]
you [sarva pApEbhya:] from all
misfortune that comes in the way of devotion.
		</text>
		<text> [mA shucha:] Don't worry.
		</text>
		<text>



Commentary on the first view:

The duties of activity,
contemplation and devotion are
methods to achieve the ultimate goal.
		</text>
		<text> Do them with
affection towards Me, with My worship as the purpose.
		</text>
		<text> Leave the outcomes,
possessiveness towards the action and the misconception that you make things
happen.
		</text>
		<text> 

Have Me and only Me as the Performer, as
the One who is worshipped, as the Goal, and as the Method to achieve the goal.
		</text>
		<text>
This is what's meant by the phrase 'letting go of everything that is to be
achieved', as mentioned in this Shloka and as described in the scriptures.
		</text>
		<text>

It was thoroughly described in this
chapter, starting with Chap.18#4: 'Listen to My clarification of 'letting go', which is done in three ways'.
		</text>
		<text> Then,
Chap.18#9 talked about 'letting go' of attachment and
outcomes.
		</text>
		<text> This is regarded as being in the quality of sattva.
		</text>
		<text>


It concluded in Chap.18#11: 'Indeed, it's
not possible for a person having a body to give up all activity without
exception.
		</text>
		<text> On the other hand, a person who leaves the outcome of his action is
the one who has let-go'.
		</text>
		<text>

I will free you from all misfortune.
		</text>
		<text>
Misfortunes prevent you from being with Me.
		</text>
		<text> They come from missed duties and
misdeeds, committed since beginning-less time.
		</text>
		<text> In this Shloka, The Lord says- You
let-go in this way, and I shall free you from all misfortune.
		</text>
		<text> 

Don't worry.
		</text>
		<text>

Commentary on the second view:

Devotion to The
Lord happens when we adore The Lord, free of all misfortune and its regrets.
		</text>
		<text>


However, our misfortunes are unending,
having collected since beginning-less time.
		</text>
		<text> They will come in the way of our devotion.
		</text>
		<text> 

In the limited time we have, it isn't
possible to do everything towards redeeming an infinite amount of misfortune.
		</text>
		<text>
Hence, Arjuna feels sad that he isn't qualified to begin devotion.
		</text>
		<text> 

To remove Arjuna's sorrow, the Lord tells
him - 'Let go of every regret and reparation that stands in the way of devotion.
		</text>
		<text> Surrender to Me alone'.
		</text>
		<text>

We have committed all kinds of deeds since
beginning-less time.
		</text>
		<text> We accumulate misfortune when we commit misdeeds or when
we miss our duties.
		</text>
		<text> In this way, all of us have accumulated a great variety of
unlimited misfortune.
		</text>
		<text> All this comes in the way of devotion.
		</text>
		<text>


We need to make a lot of amends and
reparations to get rid of all our misfortune.
		</text>
		<text> Since we have a limited lifespan,
it isn't possible to make enough reparations.
		</text>
		<text> 

That's why The Lord says - Let go of all
these regrets that are impossible to repair, which stand in the way of devotion.
		</text>
		<text> Surrender to Me alone - I am ultimately
compassionate, I don't consider anyone to be peculiar, I am the refuge of
everyone without exception, I am an ocean of affection to those who take refuge
in Me.
		</text>
		<text> I shall free you from every misfortune that comes in the way of
practicing devotion, as I've stated.
		</text>
		<text> 

Don't worry.
		</text>
		<text>

This awareness is very subtle.
		</text>
		<text> It was told
by Me for your sake.
		</text>
		<text> 

Do not narrate it to someone who doesn't
take the effort to think.
		</text>
		<text> 

It must never be told to someone who isn't
devoted to Me and doesn't appreciate you, as the carrier of awareness.
		</text>
		<text> Meaning
- even if a person has taken efforts to think and meditate, this knowledge
isn't for him, when he isn't devoted to Me and to you.
		</text>
		<text> 

Even if a person is devoted, this isn't for
him when he doesn't have the intention to listen.
		</text>
		<text> 

Finally, it's not for the individual who
finds fault whenever My virtues, My characteristics, and My possessions are
described.
		</text>
		<text> 

The emphasis on the individual at the end
signifies that such a person must be avoided exclusively, while conveying this awareness.

[arjuna uvAcha]
Arjuna said - [achyuta]
Krishna, [tvat prasAdAt] by
Your grace, [smr'ti:] this awareness
[labdhA] has been grasped [mayA] by me.
		</text>
		<text> [mOha:] My delusion [naShTa:] is gone.
		</text>
		<text> [asmi] I
am [sthita:] standing [gata saMdEha:] free of doubt.
		</text>
		<text> [kariShyE] I will do [tava vachanam] as you say.
		</text>
		<text>



'Delusion' is the belief that goes against
reality.
		</text>
		<text> 'Awareness' is the knowledge of things as they are.
		</text>
		<text> Arjuna tells
Krishna - 'By Your grace, my delusion is gone.
		</text>
		<text> By Your grace itself, this awareness
has been grasped by me'.
		</text>
		<text>

Delusion is to believe that I am my body,
without recognizing the Self.
		</text>
		<text> 

Awareness is to know and recognize that
everything - be it conscious or non-conscious - exists as the Lord's body - He
is the Self in everything.
		</text>
		<text> 

Delusion is to consider existence, without
having the Lord as the Self in everything.
		</text>
		<text> 

Awareness is to recognize that our routine
activities and prescribed duties are the Lord's worship.
		</text>
		<text> We achieve the Lord by
performing those activities and duties.
		</text>
		<text> Believing them to be binding in nature
is delusion.
		</text>
		<text> Such delusion is gone now.
		</text>
		<text>

The Self is distinct from the environment
and doesn't carry any characteristic of the environment.
		</text>
		<text> Its only
characteristic is the ability to know.
		</text>
		<text> It exists for the purpose of the Lord
alone.
		</text>
		<text> Being governed by the Lord is its natural state of being.
		</text>
		<text>

The Lord has the creation, sustenance and
the destruction of the entire universe as His sport.
		</text>
		<text> 

He repels all flaws without exception.
		</text>
		<text> His
form is purely gratifying.
		</text>
		<text> 

By His very nature, He is a great ocean of
unbroken, unlimited knowledge, strength, wealth, valor, power, luster and other
such favorable characteristics.
		</text>
		<text> 

He is known as [parabrahma] - the supreme expanse.
		</text>
		<text> 'Awareness' is such knowledge of The Lord in
His true form.
		</text>
		<text> 

Arjuna says - 'I have attained knowledge in
this form - I now know the true characteristics of the Supreme Being.
		</text>
		<text> I know
the distinction between this Supreme Being and the rest.
		</text>
		<text> 

I will end up adoring the Lord by
practicing my routine and prescribed activities, having Him as my only purpose
- even in the resolution of guilt.
		</text>
		<text> Then, with equanimity and self-control, I
experience bliss in the characteristics of the Self.
		</text>
		<text> This gains the form of
devotion.
		</text>
		<text> 

The Supreme Lord, who is the subject of all
the Vedanta, can only be attained by the worship of the Supreme Lord.
		</text>
		<text>

I know that You, the son of Vasudeva, are
the Supreme Lord.
		</text>
		<text>

Moreover, I'm free of the exhaustion, which
was caused by delusion.
		</text>
		<text> That delusion was fueled by feelings of pity and
affection towards relatives.
		</text>
		<text> I now stand fit.
		</text>
		<text> I will do as you say right now,
in war and in all other ways.
		</text>
		<text> I shall fight'.
		</text>
		<text>

Next, Sanjaya answers Dhrtarashtra, who had
asked what his sons and the Pandava were doing in battle.

[sanjaya uvAcha] Sanjaya said - [iti] Thus, [aham ashrUSham] I listened to [imam saMvAdam] this conversation [vAsudEvasya] between Krishna [cha] and [mahAtmana:]
the great man [arjuna] Arjuna.
		</text>
		<text> [adbhutam] It is marvelous [rOmaharShaNam] and fabulously stimulating.
		</text>
		<text>



This was the conversation between Lord
Krishna and Arjuna.
		</text>
		<text> We know Krishna as the son of Vasudeva, and his Arjuna as
his cousin, a great man with a great intellect, who has taken refuge in the
feet of the Lord.
		</text>
		<text> 

I listened as it was spoken.
		</text>
		<text> It's a
conversation that's marvelous and fabulously stimulating.

]

[vyAsa prasAdAt] By the grace of Vyasa, [aham shrutavAn] I've listened to [Etat guhyam] this subtle, [param yOgam] superior practice of the Lord [kathayata:] described [kr'ShNAt] by Krishna, [yOgEshvarAt] the Lord of the practice [svayam] Himself, [sAkShAt]
as though I was present there myself.
		</text>
		<text>



The word [yOga] here has been translated to the word 'practice'.
		</text>
		<text> It is the practice
of recognizing things as they are.
		</text>
		<text> It is the practice of recognizing the Lord's
infinite powers and activities.
		</text>
		<text> This has been explained as a 'state of being'
in Chap.6#20-23 and as the Lord's discipline and action in Chap.10#7.
		</text>
		<text>

Sanjaya continues - By the grace of Vyasa,
I obtained divine sight and divine listening.
		</text>
		<text> With that, I listened to this
subtle, superior practice called yoga - from the Lord of yoga Himself.
		</text>
		<text> 

Yoga is the practice of recognizing The
Lord, who is a treasure trove of knowledge, strength, wealth, valor, power and luster.
		</text>
		<text>
I listened as if I was there and Krishna Himself narrated it to me.

Lord Krishna revealed His extraordinarily

Enough said -

[yatra] Where
there is [kr'ShNa:] Krishna, [yOgEshvara:] the Lord of being; [yatra] where there is [pArtha:] Arjuna [dhanurdhara:] with his bow - [tatra] that is where [shrI:] prosperity, [vijaya:] victory, [bhUti:]
wealth [nIti:] and ethics [dhruvA] stand firm.
		</text>
		<text> [mama mati:] This is my conviction.
		</text>
		<text>



Krishna is in each of us
and He is our best friend.
		</text>
		<text> Everything we need will come to us.
		</text>
		<text>

Krishna is the Lord of being - everything
that exists as superior, inferior, conscious or non-conscious has a nature, and
a state-of-being that Lord Krishna owns.
		</text>
		<text> His will determines the form, state
and continued existence of everything else.
		</text>
		<text> 

Wherever there's Lord Krishna, the son of
Vasudeva and his cousin Arjuna, who has taken refuge in the Lord's feet alone -
that's where prosperity, victory, wealth and ethics stand firm.
		</text>
		<text> Sanjaya
concludes - 'This is my conviction'.
