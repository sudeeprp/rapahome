<h1>Chapter 14</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
In the 13th chapter, the characteristics of
the Self and the environment were described, along with their association. Then,
several <a href="Chapter%2013.html#virtues_amanitvam">virtues</a>
 were listed, such as being
without a sense of superiority. These virtues help in realizing the Self. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
With these virtues, <a href="Chapter%207.html#bhakti_a_defn">devotion</a>

and the Lord's compassion, a person is <a href="Back%20to%20Basics.html#Moksha">freed</a>
 from
material bonds. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The cause of the bond with the material
world was also stated - the bond is due to our desires, such as our craving for
happiness. The <a href="Chapter%202.html#satva_rajas_tamas">three qualities</a>
 soak the
desires of the material world with their influence. This was told in
<a href="Chapter%2013.html#21">Chapter 13-21</a>: 'The Self is bound to the environment due to its association with
the <a href="Chapter%202.html#satva_rajas_tamas">three qualities</a>
 in births that came from
virtue and flaws'.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Next, in this chapter, the Lord describes
the way in which these <a href="Chapter%202.html#satva_rajas_tamas">three qualities</a>
 bind
us, along with the method to gain freedom from these <a href="Chapter%202.html#satva_rajas_tamas">qualities</a>
.</span>

</p>


</div>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The Lord says - 'What I am going to say now
is beyond what I have said before'. Meaning, it is not a repetition. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
He says - 'I will elaborate the <a href="Chapter%202.html#satva_rajas_tamas">three qualities</a>
 once again - qualities that are
embedded in the environment, in which the Self is bound. This knowledge is the
base for everything there is to know about the Self and its association with the
environment. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
All those who gained insight from this
knowledge have reached the supreme goal, crossing over this material world. Here,
the supreme goal is the realization of the Self in its true form'.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
In the next Shloka, the Lord describes this
knowledge and the benefit of knowing it.</span>

<span lang=EN-US >
By knowing what I'm elaborating next,
people achieve My characteristics - they gain equality to Me. They are not born
at the time of creation. Meaning, they remain unaffected in the act of
creation. Hence, they don't perish either, remaining unaffected when the
universe comes to an end. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Each and every being that isn't free is
bound to the environment. Every such being is a combination of the environment
with a Self. This was stated already in <a href="Chapter%2013.html#26">Chapter 13-26</a>: 'Anything moving or
stationary comes into being by an association of a Self with a body formed from
the environment'. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Beings like us are bound to the environment
by the <a href="Chapter%202.html#satva_rajas_tamas">three qualities</a>
. To explain how, the
Lord starts by stating that all beings are created by His will alone.</span>

</div>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
My universe is the origin from which everything
came into being. That is My womb. In that, I infuse consciousness and give
birth. The Lord described this in <a href="Chapter%207.html#4">Chapter 7-4</a> by explaining His material
attribute: 'This universe of mine is divided into eight categories: Solids,
liquids, gasses, energy, space, mind, the gross collections and the notion of
individuality.'</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Before creation, the Lord's inanimate
matter exists as the <a href="Chapter%2013.html#subtle_singularity">subtle singularity</a>
. At
the time of creation, it changes into plasma, then into the state in which
subatomic particles were formed, then the atoms and then the five elements of
Solids, liquids, gasses, energy and space<i >
.</i>
</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Since it expands into this huge universe,
it's called as </span>
<span lang=EN-US >
[mahat brahma]</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
,
the one which becomes huge.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<i >
<span lang=EN-US >
It is not common to use the word </span>
</i>
<i >
<span lang=EN-US >
[brahma]</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
 to refer to the universe. The word </span>
</i>
<i >
<span lang=EN-US >
[brahma]</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
 means something that's expansive.
Though it is commonly used to describe the principal architect of the universe,
it is also used in several places to mean the universe itself. This is illustrated
next.</span>
</i>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
In the scriptures, the universe has been
referred to by the word </span>
<span lang=EN-US >
[brahma]</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
, as in </span>
<span lang=EN-US style='font-size:8.0pt;line-height:
150%' >
[muMDaka, 1-1-9]</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
: 'This material world gets
created, becomes recognizable and gets ready to be experienced. This material
world, known as 'brahma' comes from the One who is aware of everything, has
full depth of understanding and whose endeavors are full of awareness'. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The inanimate matter in the material world
is one attribute of the Lord. The conscious Self is the other. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The Self is described to be beyond the material
environment in <a href="Chapter%207.html#5">Chapter 7-5</a>: 'My ultimate nature is distinct from the universe. It
is in the form of a conscious being by whom this world is sustained'. This
supreme attribute of the Lord has been described as the set of all that's
conscious. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The conscious Self, when infused in the
environment, acts as the seed to create all beings. This is how these beings
are created in the womb. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The Lord continues - 'In the huge universe,
which is My inanimate womb, I give birth - I bring together this environment
and the collection of consciousness.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The inanimate environment is experienced;
The Self is the one who experiences - this attribute of Mine brings
consciousness to the world. I bring the Self and its environment together. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Then, all beings, right from the principal
engineer of the universe down to a germ, come into being from My two attributes
- the environment and the Self. They are joined by My will'.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Next, the Lord says that even after creating
this universe, He continues to bring together His inanimate and conscious
attributes in each being that is born.</span>

<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
All beings in this universe have their
origin in the material of the cosmic inflation.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
That includes all humans - powerful,
ordinary, handsome, ugly, cruel, kind, along with all animals, birds, plants
and so on. All of their various forms originated from the plasma that formed
during creation.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
In this Shloka, The Lord says 'I have put
together all conscious beings. Their bodies are made from the matter in the
environment, which formed from the results of the cosmic inflation. I am the
One who infuses life in the embryo, during their birth' - The Lord puts
together the Self and the body of all conscious beings in accordance with their
deeds.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
In this way, the Lord explained that
conscious beings get associated with inanimate matter at the start of creation.
This association happens due to the influence of various deeds they committed
in the past.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Next, He explains the reason why they
repeatedly take birth in various wombs in different forms. </span>

and other forms. </span>

<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
A Self that's bound to the environment is
associated with one of these bodies. It is the owner of that body. While the
body changes, the Self never changes or wears out. By its nature, the Self is
not associated with the <a href="Chapter%202.html#satva_rajas_tamas">three qualities</a>
. Yet it's
tied down by them when it is in the body.  Its bondage is caused by being
inside a body.</span>

As described, people who are situated in <a href="Chapter%2014.html#sattva">sattva</a>
 ascend to eminence. They are progressive and gain
freedom from material bonds, achieving <a href="Back%20to%20Basics.html#Moksha">liberty</a>

<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The quality of <a href="Chapter%2014.html#rajas">rajas</a>

gives rise to avarice - people who are high on <a href="Chapter%2014.html#rajas">rajas</a>
 covet
the good life. They yearn for fame, wealth and comforts. They work to achieve
those results. They are born again to experience the outcome of their work. Even
in the next birth, they work similarly and get stuck in the cycle. That's why
they stay mediocre. Due to its tendency to repeat, the quality of <a href="Chapter%2014.html#rajas">rajas</a>
 inevitably causes sorrow for the most part.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Those in <a href="Chapter%2014.html#tamas">tamas</a>
 stay
and work in undesirable ways. From one life to the next, they keep cultivating
conduct that grows the quality of <a href="Chapter%2014.html#tamas">tamas</a>
. They progress to
lower forms - being born into depression, animals, insects, worms, germs,
immobile beings, plants and flowers, going on to become a blade of grass, a
stone, a stick, a lump of clay and so on.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Next, the Lord describes the way in which
people enrich <a href="Chapter%2014.html#sattva">sattva</a>
 over several births. They overcome
the influence of all <a href="Chapter%202.html#satva_rajas_tamas">qualities</a>
 and achieve the
<a href="Back%20to%20Basics.html#Moksha">supreme goal</a>
. They enrich <a href="Chapter%2014.html#sattva">sattva</a>
 with
the distinction of working without attachment, by the merit of being disciplined
in consumption.</span>

In the Gita, it
is said that the Self </span>
</i>
<span lang=EN-US >
<a href="Chapter%2013.html#self_initiates_action"><i >
takes initiative</i>
</a>
<i >
 in every action
(<a href="Chapter%2013.html#20">Chapter 13-20</a>). It also says that the Self does not make outcomes happen, as in
<a href="Chapter%2013.html#29">Chapter 13-29</a>: 'definitely, actions are due to the environment' and in
<a href="Chapter%203.html#27">Chapter 3-27</a>-28: 'An ignorant person thinks of his body as himself and does not
realize that actions are a result of the qualities of nature'. </i>
</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<i >
<span lang=EN-US >
Though the first one seems to contradict
the other two, it doesn't. The Self takes initiative - it has an intent and
initiates action. What follows is the '</span>
</i>
<span lang=EN-US >
<a href="Back%20to%20Basics.html#actions_and_happenings"><i >
happening</i>
</a>
<i >
' - the action may happen
or not; the outcome may be perceived as favorable or unfavorable; he may feel
elated or disappointed - all of these are a result of the </i>
<a href="Chapter%2014.html#satva_rajas_tamas_effects"><i >
qualities of nature</i>
</a>
<i >
. </i>
</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<i >
<span lang=EN-US >
These qualities attach to the Self as a
result of actions committed in the past. Actions are 'committed' when we
believe that what 'happens' is under our control and get attached to it,
instead of recognizing that outcomes happen as a result of the qualities of
nature.</span>

 and <a href="Chapter%2014.html#tamas">tamas</a>
 comprehensively and
cultivates <a href="Chapter%2014.html#sattva">sattva</a>
. He does this by consuming food and nourishing
the body in-line with the quality of <a href="Chapter%2014.html#sattva">sattva</a>
. With work
that's done without attachments, only for the Lord's worship, he cultivates <a href="Chapter%2014.html#sattva">sattva</a>
. It then gains predominance in him. This person has
seen and uncovered the true nature of things. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
This Shloka says - ' Other than the <a href="Chapter%202.html#satva_rajas_tamas">three qualities</a>
, an intelligent person doesn't
see a cause of outcomes in anything else'. When such a person doesn't see
anything other than the <a href="Chapter%202.html#satva_rajas_tamas">three qualities</a>
 in
making things happen, he knows beyond these <a href="Chapter%202.html#satva_rajas_tamas">qualities</a>
'</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Meaning, such a person sees that the <a href="Chapter%202.html#satva_rajas_tamas">three qualities</a>
 make outcomes happen in
accordance with their respective qualities. Having seen this, he realizes that
the Self does not make things happen. He realizes that the Self is distinct
from the <a href="Chapter%202.html#satva_rajas_tamas">qualities</a>
 that make things happen.
Such a person shall attain My state of being; he becomes equivalent to Me. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
In summary, what the Lord said is - The
Self is pure and free by nature. It is limited by attachment to actions, due to
various deeds committed in the past. This causes its 'doership' in various
actions. By nature, the Self does not make things happen. It has the form of
pure and limitless knowledge. When a person realizes this true nature of the
Self, he attains equivalence to Me.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Having seen that the Self does not make
anything happen, that it is different from the <a href="Chapter%202.html#satva_rajas_tamas">qualities</a>
,
a person attains equivalence to the Lord - this has been said. What does it
mean to attain equivalence to the Lord? That is explained next.</span>

Arjuna asked three questions about the
one who has crossed over the qualities - his characteristics, behavior and
method of crossing over the </span>
</i>
<span lang=EN-US >
<a href="Chapter%202.html#satva_rajas_tamas"><i >
qualities</i>
</a>
<i >
. The characteristics were
covered in the previous Shlokas. This Shloka is about behavior and the next two
are about the method.</i>
</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
This person considers comfort and sorrow
equally by standing in his Self. Being content with his Self, he considers
everything else - joys and sorrows, births and deaths - with equanimity. In the
same way, he has the same outlook towards a lump of clay, a stone or gold,
weighing the favorable and the unfavorable equally. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
This person knows the Self from the body,
hence he weighs praise and insults equally - praise and insults relate to some advantages
and shortcomings, which are limitations of the body. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
They aren't related to the Self. If we care
for them, it is due to the misconception that the human form is the Self. This
misconception gives rise to fame, infamy, friendly and unfriendly perceptions.
Actually, none of them relate to the Self. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
In this way, the person relates equally to
all of them, being able to leave attachment to any pursuit that comes from
owning a body. This person is said to have crossed over the <a href="Chapter%202.html#satva_rajas_tamas">qualities</a>
.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Next, the Lord states the greatest enabler
in crossing over these <a href="Chapter%202.html#satva_rajas_tamas">qualities</a>
.</span>

The method of distinguishing the body from
the Self was described starting with <a href="Chapter%2014.html#19">Chapter 14-19</a>, 'When the person realizes that
the <a href="Chapter%202.html#satva_rajas_tamas">three qualities</a>
 make things happen, not
the Self, nothing else...'. </span>

<span lang=EN-US style='color:black' >
The <a href="Chapter%202.html#satva_rajas_tamas">three qualities</a>
 can only be overcome by
surrendering to the Lord with <a href="Chapter%207.html#bhakti_a_defn">devotion</a>
.</span>
</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Just by knowing the distinction and
thinking about the Self and the body, a person doesn't earn the right to cross
over the <a href="Chapter%202.html#satva_rajas_tamas">three qualities</a>
. He is still checked
by the undesirable influence of past deeds - an influence that has lingered
from beginning-less time.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
In this Shloka, the Lord says - 'I am the
One whose every intent is realized. I am the One with unsurpassed compassion,
an ocean of affection to those who <a href="Chapter%207.html#Sharanagati">surrender</a>
 to Me. The
<a href="Chapter%202.html#satva_rajas_tamas">qualities</a>
 are difficult to overcome. A person
crosses over them when he serves and experiences Me with <a href="Chapter%207.html#bhakti_a_defn">constant devotion</a>
 - a devotion that's distinguished by
its unwavering focus on one goal. This person is cut out to experience the Self
- he becomes fit to realize the Self. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Meaning, he achieves the Self in its true
form, indestructible and inexhaustible.</span>

<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The phrase 'I am the basis' is used here to
mean that the Lord is 'the cause of existence'.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The Lord says 'I am the One served and
experienced with unwavering <a href="Chapter%207.html#bhakti_a_defn">devotion</a>
. I am the
basis of the Self that has neither death nor decay. In the same way, I am the
cause of unending <a href="Chapter%207.html#bhakti_a_defn">devotion</a>
, as well as the
constant, infinite, absolute joy of <a href="Back%20to%20Basics.html#Moksha">being free</a>
'. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
This was described in <a href="Chapter%207.html#19">Chapter 7-19</a>: 'Lord
Krishna is everything' - The Lord is the cause of joy achieved by the <a href="Chapter%207.html#jnAnI">one who knows</a>
. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Though the ever-lasting practice of <a href="Chapter%207.html#bhakti_a_defn">devotion</a>
 is a 'method' to achieve the Lord, it is
described before and after this Shloka as an achievement in itself. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
It is both a 'method' and the
'achievement', due to the fact that <a href="Chapter%207.html#bhakti_a_defn">devotion</a>
 and
the Lord always go together. This has been said before, starting in <a href="Chapter%207.html#14">Chapter 7-14</a> -
'These divine creations of Mine are pervaded by the <a href="Chapter%202.html#satva_rajas_tamas">three
qualities</a>
. They are indeed impossible to cross over. The people who <a href="Chapter%207.html#Sharanagati">surrender</a>
 exclusively to Me will cross over this
material world'. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The Lord said that surrendering to Him is
the only way to cross over <a href="Chapter%202.html#satva_rajas_tamas">material qualities</a>
.
Before crossing over, we pursue goals of self-realization, wealth and the Lord
Himself. Surrendering to Him is the way to achieve them as well. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Only by surrendering exclusively to the
Lord can we cross-over <a href="Chapter%202.html#satva_rajas_tamas">material qualities</a>
 and
gain equivalence to Him.</span>
