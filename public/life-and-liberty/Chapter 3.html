<h1>Chapter 3</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The Lord is the goal of those who seek <a href="Back%20to%20Basics.html#Moksha">liberation</a>
. The Lord has been described as a repository of
an infinite amount of endless virtues, repelling every kind of misfortune.
Attaining the Lord is all about supreme devotion, variously called by terms
such as worship and meditation. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The Lord has been described as 'The Self
that relieves every Self of its misfortune' in </span>
<span lang=EN-US style='font-size:8.0pt;line-height:150%' >
[ChAndOgya]</span>
<span lang=EN-US style='font-size:8.0pt;line-height:150%' >
, 8-7-1</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
In fact, working without being driven, achieving
supreme skill in our work, realizing the Self, its relation to the Lord,
devotion to the Lord and attaining the Lord are equivalent - they are presented
as a sequence. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The nature of the Self is beyond the states
of being awake, asleep or in deep sleep. It was stated that the Self does not
have a form that we can perceive. </span>
<span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
8.0pt;line-height:150%' >
[ChAndOgya]</span>
<span lang=EN-US style='font-size:

, 8-12-2</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
 states that it shines
brightly in its own form. It is said in the </span>
<span lang=EN-US style='font-size:8.0pt;line-height:150%' >
[kaThOpanishat]</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
 as well: In the quest to realize the Self, a person will worship
the Lord, get to know Him and will break free of happiness and sorrow. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The content of the previous chapter is also
stated in the </span>
<span lang=EN-US style='font-size:8.0pt;line-height:150%' >
[kaThOpanishat]</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
: The Self is not born and doesn't die. It is subtle even in
comparison to the most fundamental particle. The wise person knows it to be
great and limitless, so he doesn't worry. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The </span>
<span lang=EN-US style='font-size:8.0pt;line-height:150%' >
[kaThOpanishat]</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
 also says- this Self is not attained by speaking about it, by
thinking about it or even by hearing its characteristics repeatedly. The Self is
attained by the person who has been chosen by the Lord. It reveals itself to
this person. The Lord chooses those who choose the Lord. This is devotion. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
 </span>
<span lang=EN-US style='font-size:

[kaThOpanishat]</span>
<span lang=EN-US style='font-size:8.0pt;line-height:150%' >
, 1-3-9</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
 says- The
person who has knowledge as the guiding force and keeps his mind under control
will attain great heights and reach the Lord's abode.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
In the next four chapters, the Lord talks
about realizing the Self and the methods to achieve that realization.</span>

Arjuna asks
Lord Krishna:</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
If your opinion is that knowledge is better
than action, why are you urging me to perform these gruesome actions? Let's
elaborate Arjuna's question:</span>
</p>


<table class=ApplNotes border=0><tr><td class=ApplNotes align="center"><img class=ApplNotesImg src="step_2.png"></td><td><p class=ApplNotes id=inlineapplnote45 >
<span lang=EN-US style='color:black' >
Should I employ my
organs in activity? Or pull them back?</span>
</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
On one hand, <a href="Chapter%202.html#_50">it was told</a>

that focused meditation is the means to realizing the Self. Proficiency in working
without being driven by desire is the means to achieve this focus. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
On the other hand, the advice <a href="Chapter%202.html#_59">was
to avoid the indulgence</a>
 of our organs and the mind in sensory perceptions
such as touch and sound. This was the means to achieve the knowledge required
to realize the Self.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
If indeed, ceasing the indulgence of the
sense organs is the way to realize the Self, then I would focus only on
meditation. That would be the way to get rid of the effects of all my past
actions. Why do you urge me to perform gruesome deeds that involve indulgence
of all the sense organs, which works against the realization of the Self? </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
It feels like I am deluded by mixed and
contradictory statements. On the one hand, I need to stop indulging in sensual
perceptions to gain knowledge about the Self. On the other hand, the directive
to work is opposite to that. This is a mixed message. Hence, tell me one
statement that is not mixed- implementing which I will certainly attain
excellence.</span>

it's via accomplishing deeds without being driven by desire.</span>
</p>


</div>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Lord Krishna says- You have not grasped
what was said before. What I said before is that the world is full of different
people, who are entitled to different things. I described the two types of
practices- knowledge and action- without any mix-up: These two practices are to
be followed by people who are qualified to perform them. Indeed, not everyone who
desires <a href="Back%20to%20Basics.html#Moksha">moksha</a>
 is directly qualified to pursue the knowledge
of the Self. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
However, everyone is definitely entitled to
work without attachments, doing it as My service. They get rid of their flaws
by performing such actions. Their organs lose all their agitation. Then, they qualify
to realize the Self.</span>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
It is said in <a href="Chapter%2018.html#46">Chapter 18-46</a>: 'Any human being
attains the goal by worshipping the Lord with his own work - The Lord, by whom
all this is pervaded, from whom all beings get their ability to commence action'</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
In this way, it is explained that actions
done just as a service to the Lord will lead us to our goal of <a href="Back%20to%20Basics.html#Moksha">moksha</a>
.
In the previous chapter, <a href="Chapter%202.html#47">Chapter 2-47</a> said 'You have the authority only in action'-
Working without being driven by desire moves our intellect beyond the delusions
and desires arising from association with material objects. </span>
</p>


<table class=ApplNotes border=0><tr><td class=ApplNotes align="center"><img class=ApplNotesImg src="step_0.png"></td><td><p class=ApplNotes id=inlineapplnote47 >

The characteristics of a person who is
standing <a href="Chapter%202.html#sthitaprajna_xlat">firm in wisdom</a>
 are described starting
in <a href="Chapter%202.html#55">Chapter 2-55</a>: 'When a person gives up all desires that enter the mind, then, he
is said to be standing <a href="Chapter%202.html#sthitaprajna_xlat">firm in wisdom</a>
'. <a name="jnAnayOga_a_defn" >
</a>
The technique of contemplation was described. This
technique is called [<a href="jnanayoga.html#jnAnayOga_a_defn">jnAnayOga</a>
].
It is for people who can reason out the knowledge of the Self through their
intellect alone. People with such focused intellect are called </span>
<span lang=EN-US >
[sAnkhyA:]</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
. The word </span>
<span lang=EN-US >
[sankhyA]</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
 means intellect. These people can
focus on the knowledge of the Self alone without wavering.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
In summary: People are always entitled to
do their work without being driven by desire - even people whose intellect is still
turned by material objects. Others whose intellect remains unaffected are qualified
to contemplate using that intellect. Both of them are different paths to
achieve <a href="Back%20to%20Basics.html#Moksha">moksha</a>
.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Thus, nothing contradictory or mixed-up was
said.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The next Shloka says that the exclusive practice
of contemplation is very difficult for all people - even those in whom the desire
for <a href="Back%20to%20Basics.html#Moksha">moksha</a>
 has taken birth.</span>

If you just avoid initiating the work that
you need to do, you do not attain freedom from the influence of your deeds-
meaning, you wouldn't qualify to focus your thought on the Self. You wouldn't qualify
by abandoning the activity that you've started, either. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Liberation is achieved by performing
actions as worship to the Supreme Lord, without being driven by desire for outcomes.
</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Without such actions, you will not reach
the goal of <a href="Back%20to%20Basics.html#Moksha">moksha</a>
. When you don't worship Lord Govinda
with actions that are free from desire, the influence of your activity shackles
you. These shackles accumulate indefinitely over time. You would not let go of your
flaws, you wouldn't rid your organs of agitation and you would not qualify to focus
your thought on the Self.</span>

Without losing the influence of past deeds,
a person wouldn't have conquered his senses and his mind. When such a person
sets out to realize the Self, he is still drawn towards sensual objects. He

realizing the Self, his purpose is diverted in other ways; his actions are also
diverted towards other things. </span>

</div>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The word </span>
<span lang=EN-US >
[niyatam]</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
 is used here to mean 'invariably accompanied with'. Everyone who is
associated with matter is invariably accompanied by activity. Such is the
relation between the person and activity. Thus, activity is certainly available
to everyone, due to the influence of innumerable actions committed in the past.
Activity is easy and isn't associated with the danger of ignorance. Hence,
certainly perform action. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The word 'inactivity' is used here to mean
'the mere practice of contemplation without involving our organs in action'-
see (<a href="Chapter%203.html#4">Chapter 3-4</a>), where it says 'By avoiding actions, a person cannot get rid of
the influence of his past deeds'. Definitely, action is better than mere
contemplation on the Self.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Even for a person who is able to contemplate
on the Self as an intellectual activity, the pursuit is extremely difficult -
that's because he does not have the experience of being inactive. It isn't
possible to control this method. This pursuit is also associated with the
danger of falling into ignorance. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Hence, being with activity is definitely
better than merely striving for knowledge.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
While imparting the knowledge of the Self
in its true form, it is explained later (<a href="Chapter%205.html#14">Chapter 5-14</a>) that the Self is not the
doer when we perform an action - by its very nature, it doesn't make the
outcome happen. Thus, the knowledge about the true nature of the Self is
included inside actions that are performed without attachment to outcomes. In
this way, these actions are superior.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The statement that activity is superior to inaction
holds true indeed, even for a person who is able to focus on the Self. Suppose this
person were to give up all activity, pursuing the knowledge of the Self alone. That's
not entirely possible since the practice of contemplation itself happens as an
activity inside his body and that is definitely not inactive. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Till the realization of the Self is
complete, you need to be associated with a body.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Worship the Lord with wealth accumulated
through just means. Conduct your journey in this life inside your body, with the
balance coming from this worship. In the </span>
<span lang=EN-US style='font-size:8.0pt;line-height:150%' >
[ChAndOgya upanishad] (7-26-2)</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
, it is said- 'If what we eat is pure, the content of our body will
be pure. When the content is pure, our <a href="Chapter%202.html#sthitaprajna_xlat">consciousness
is firm</a>
'. Further on, in (Chap.3-13), it is said: 'The person who cooks for
his own sake will suffer guilt'. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Thus, even if an intellectual in the
pursuit of the Self wanted to avoid activity, the journey through the life of
his body would be impossible without any activity. This person needs to perform
worship and other duties, till his goal of realizing the Self is met.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The realization of the Self comes from working
without being driven by outcomes - by knowing the fact that the Self is <a href="Back%20to%20Basics.html#actions_and_happenings">not the doer</a>
. The ability to work is
provided readily by nature- it is easily available. In summary, working without
being driven by outcomes is superior, even for a person who is able to meditate
on the Self as a purely intellectual activity.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Hence, without doubt, work without being
driven by outcomes.</span>
</p>


<table class=ApplNotes border=0><tr><td class=ApplNotes align="center"><img class=ApplNotesImg src="step_0.png"></td><td><p class=ApplNotes id=inlineapplnote51 >

</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Next, a question: If this is indeed so and we
need to be in action, accumulating wealth and so on, the accumulation of wealth
would be associated with the feeling that 'I am the cause' and 'This is mine'. Such
feelings cause our organs to be agitated and we fall back under the influence
of our past deeds. Isn't that so? The next Shloka answers this question.</span>

The word 'yajna' is the
procedure of 'worship'. To worship is 'to adore' and 'revere'. The Lord is to
be adored and revered by any procedure. Anything else that is adored and
revered is a part of Him. Working with such adoration is called 'worship'.</span>
</i>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Work and prosper to worship - this method
makes the Lord as the purpose of all your activities. As opposed to this,
actions done solely for personal gratification will bind and limit a person in
this world. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Hence, work and prosper for the purpose of
worship. In this process, be free of the attachment that results from doing
things for personal gratification. When you work to worship the Lord, you are free
from attachment and the Lord is gratified with your actions. He will free you
from the influence of endless actions committed over time and grant you the
realization of the Self and freedom from agitation.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The following Shlokas state that you need
to take nourishment from the balance that comes out of worship. Take care of your

things other than this balance is a mistake.</span>

The 'Lord of all beings' here refers to
Narayana, who is the ruler of everything, the cause of the creation of the
universe, who pervades it entirely, who is the supreme abode of all beings. He
created all beings long ago, at the time of creation.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
At the time of creation, the Lord knew that
many beings were helpless under the influence of their innumerable deeds. In
the singularity before creation, there was no way to distinguish things with
names. They were dissolved in the Lord himself and were unable to realize their
goals. They were as if without consciousness. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The compassionate Lord willed to bring them
to life. He created them along with the forms of worship that are required to adore
the Lord. He said- 'Prosper and grow with the various forms of <a href="Chapter%203.html#yajna">worship</a>
.
Let them (the forms of worship) give you the ultimate goal of <a href="Back%20to%20Basics.html#Moksha">moksha</a>

and also satisfy other desires that are supportive to this goal.'</span>

wealth bear fruit. You worship the Lord with it and exist in your body using
the balance that remains from worship. You get freedom from all faults that

the true nature of your Self.</span>

activities of nature (including your body) as a procedure to worship. </span>
</i>
<span lang=EN-US >

Worship</i>
</a>
<i >
 is done to please the Lord.
The Lord created everything for his own enjoyment. Hence, anything that happens

sunshine, rain, the growth of food, nourishment and so on.</i>
</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
All living beings survive by consuming
food. Food is created using rain water- this fact is known to everyone. The
fact that rain water is a result of a method of worship is stated in the
scriptures such as </span>
<span lang=EN-US >
[brahma purANa]</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
, 16-4: 'The Sun has fuel that burns. Rain happens due to the Sun'. </span>

Activity happens in the
environment, not for our purpose. The Self must engage in worship.</span>
</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Any method of worship results from activity.
An example of such activity is to earn or acquire materials. This activity pans
out in a series of transactions <a href="Back%20to%20Basics.html#actions_and_happenings">involving all
things that make the activity happen</a>
. Activity happens in the environment. In
this Shloka, the word </span>
<span lang=EN-US >
[brahma]</span>
<span lang=EN-US >

is used to denote the body, which is a contribution of nature. Our environment is
an attribute of the Lord, as said in </span>
<span lang=EN-US >
[muMDaka]</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
, 1-1-16: 'The environment, along with all things that are distinguishable
in it arise from the Supreme Lord'. Also, in (<a href="Chapter%2014.html#3">Chapter 14-3</a>), it is said 'the
entire universe is my womb'. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The word </span>
<span lang=EN-US >
[akShara]</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
 in this Shloka denotes the Self. This Self, being satisfied with
food and water, instructs the body to work. In this way, the body is the
vehicle of activity. This possibility arises in the presence of the Self.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
In summary, all actions relate to the body
and are enabled by the Self. The Self must engage in worship. Worship is the origin
of all actions. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The cycle kept in motion by the Lord runs
like this: Bodies of conscious beings comes from food; Food comes due to rain; Rain
results from a method of worship; Worship results from activity, put together
by the transactions of the doers; activity comes from bodies of conscious
beings. The bodies come from food - This is the cycle, which runs in the form
of a cause-and-effect chain.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
People who do not acknowledge and follow
this cycle while actually being in it earn a lot of guilt. They don't nurture
their bodies with the residue of worship. They spend a lifetime gathering and
finding fault. These people continue to look for contentment in the sense
organs. They do not look for contentment in the Self. Sense organs restrict their
field of play. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
With the body and mind nurtured by things
other than the residue of worship, the properties of <a href="Chapter%2014.html#rajas">rajas
(passion)</a>
 and <a href="Chapter%2014.html#tamas">tamas (ignorance)</a>
 are abundant. They are
turned away from the realization of the Self and immerse themselves in
experiencing material things alone. This applies to those who are able to contemplate,
as well as to the rest who are eligible to work without being driven by outcomes.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
In this way, they are said to waste away
life without achieving <a href="Back%20to%20Basics.html#Moksha">moksha</a>
, even while focusing their
thoughts on the Self.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The next Shloka explains that only a truly
free person isn't bound to initiate any actions. Such a person can see his Self
without the need to achieve or strive for anything.</span>

<span class="snskrtphrase">[param ApnOti]</span></span>
<span lang=EN-US >
 will attain the realization of the Self.</span>
</p>


</div>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
A person who is focused on the Self need
not do anything special to achieve the Self. The Self is automatically visible within,
by his own nature. This person naturally revels in the Self, is inclined
towards the Self and is satisfied by the Self; not by other things like food or
entertainment; he isn't arrogant because he <a href="jnanayoga.html#jnAnayOga_a_defn">knows the
Self</a>
, or because he <a href="karmayoga.html#karmayOga_a_defn">works
without attachment</a>
. His refuge, nourishment and consumption are all in the
Self alone.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Due to this, anything done by him for the
purpose of achieving the Self is of no added benefit. If he stays without doing
anything to achieve the Self, there is no loss- he can see the Self without any
effort or strife. Being disinterested in anything other than the Self, he does
not have a dependency in the form of 'this is useful to me', towards any
inanimate object. He does not need to do anything to achieve this independence.
He is truly free.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
He does not indulge in accomplishments,
since he does not need any accomplishment to realize the Self. Even for those
who are involved in accomplishing things, the best action is </span>
<span lang=EN-US >
[karmayOga]</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
 - working without attachment
towards its outcome. It's easy to practice, is free of fault and has the
knowledge of the Self embedded in it.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Due to this reason, keep working without
any attachment until the Self is realized. Consider your action merely as a
duty - 'something to be done'. The person who practices this form of action -
without believing that he is the cause of the <a href="Back%20to%20Basics.html#actions_and_happenings">outcome</a>

- will attain the supreme goal (<a href="Back%20to%20Basics.html#Moksha">moksha</a>
) and realize the
Self.</span>

Thus, the champions, famous for their

attached to activities linked to these qualities. They don't know the true form

That's why a person who realizes the nature
of the Self, who is considered superior, must stay active - while practicing
the fact that the Self doesn't make things happen. This way, he demonstrates
that the technique of <a href="karmayoga.html#karmayoga">working without

With this thought in mind, don't have any
possessive feelings like 'these are my actions'. Be free from anxieties like 'How

techniques will anyway require activity, since we are endowed with a body. Pure
meditation that doesn't involve any activity is not possible.</span>

It was already stated that people who are
famous must specially follow the technique of <a href="karmayoga.html#karmayOga_a_defn">working
without attachment</a>
. Next, in the remainder of this chapter, The Lord says
that it isn't possible to gain the knowledge of the Self in any other way. Any
technique that avoids activity is ridden with flaws.</span>

</div>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Consider a person who knows the scriptures,
which describe the Self in a particular way, stating that you must always
restrain yourself and focus on the Self. Such a person is also drawn by the
influence of actions committed in the past. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
That's because all beings that are attached
to inanimate matter are drawn by the influence of <a href="Chapter%202.html#satva_rajas_tamas">the
three qualities</a>
. These qualities are the result of deeds committed since
eternity. Under such an influence, what can restraint do? Just knowing about 'restraint'
as prescribed in the scriptures doesn't help by itself.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >

Next, it is explained how a person falls

<p class=MsoNormal >

Sound, touch and other stimuli bring
awareness by activating the senses. Organs of activity give us the experience
of doing- for example, the organs of speech give us the experience of speaking.
The craving to experience them is desire, which is inevitable. This 'craving'
is a result of the influence of our deeds committed since ancient times. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
When the desired experience is blocked, it
inevitably results in ill-feelings like hatred. Desire and hatred together
bring us under their control. They use us to achieve their effects, even if we
have embarked on the journey to realize the Self, even if we have restrained our
sense organs. Once under their control, we divert from the path of realizing
the Self and will be destroyed. </span>

Desire uses the organs of the body, the
mind and the intellect to invade the Self and control it. The body, mind and
intellect are said to be the abode of desire. They tend to get attached to the
material world, building up desire. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
In this way, desire hides the Self,
conceals its knowledge and confuses a person. Desire makes a person turn away
from realizing the Self and turns him towards the sensual world.</span>

<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
For a person who intends to realize the
Self by meditation, this enemy called desire makes him turn towards worldly
attractions. It makes him turn away from the Self. Due to the nature of your
association with this world, you are still inclined towards the activities of your
sense organs. Hence, bind your organs to work without desire for outcomes -
right at the beginning of your quest to realize the Self and attain <a href="Back%20to%20Basics.html#Moksha">moksha</a>
.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Abandon desire in this way. Otherwise it
will destroy knowledge, wisdom and the realization of the true nature of the
Self.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
In the next Shloka, the Lord explains the
main obstacles to realize the Self.</span>

 It is this thing called desire,

</p>


</div>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
It is said that our external organs are
prominent obstacles to realizing the Self. Indeed, when your sense organs
indulge themselves in the stimuli of this world, knowledge of the Self cannot
grow. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The mind is even more powerful than these
organs. Even when you restrain your external organs, if your mind is
preoccupied with worldly objects, knowledge of the Self remains hidden. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Even when the mind is restrained from all
such preoccupations, if the intellect decides against it, there is no way you
can realize the Self.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Even when the intellect is in the right
direction, 'desire', which is born out of the quality of <a href="Chapter%202.html#satva_rajas_tamas">rajas</a>
, will bring the organs and the mind under
its control. It will force them to indulge in worldly things. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Thus, it will stop the person from
realizing the Self. In this way, desire is a more powerful obstacle than the
intellect.</span>
