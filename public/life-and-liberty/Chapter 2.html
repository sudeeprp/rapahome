 This confusion is not fit

<span lang=EN-US >

When Arjuna sat down this way, Lord Krishna
considered - 'Why did this sorrow come at such an inappropriate time?' and said
'Abandon this weakness, which is the property of people without wisdom. It
results in disgrace and does not help you in any place or situation. Get up to
fight'.</span>

This is not as obvious as it sounds,
when we ask ourselves who we are. Our body is put together from atoms that are
part of the universe. In time, every atom in our body would be exchanged. So,
everything just seems to be a part of the physical universe, where distinctions
like 'you' and 'me' are not real and purely made for convenience. Within such a
belief, our consciousness seems to be an imaginary concept in the physical
universe. </span>

It is improbable that the organized

As an example, the law of gravitation

Likewise, the supreme law that governs
the whole universe would be knowledge and the rest of the universe - including

determine this reality - the supreme law must allow us to find it, since it

Thus, the Lord, as the owner of everything,

the Lord uses the phrases 'I', 'you', 'all these people' and 'we'. The opinion

reason is incorrect - the distinction has been clarified by the Lord. </span>

Is there any

</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
What if these distinctions are imaginary
and we believe them to be real, due to ignorance? This doesn't hold - The Lord
is supreme and these are His statements. If the Lord were to be the only real
entity without any attributes, unchanged and permanent, ignorance doesn't
happen. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
So, the Lord's statement that we are many
and are distinct from the Lord couldn't have been made in ignorance. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
What if knowledge and ignorance coexist in
the Lord, who remains unaffected by that ignorance? The analogy given to
illustrate this possibility is that of a burnt piece of cloth or paper, left
undisturbed. Though it may have retained its shape, it doesn't have its
original function. However, this doesn't hold either. For example, a mirage
makes the illusion of water. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
However, once we know that a mirage can do
that, we will not reach out to fetch water from it or&nbsp;initiate any action
based upon such an illusion again. In the same way, if all distinctions were
due to ignorance and such ignorance was resolved, there wouldn't be a situation
in which the Lord would explain these distinctions to Arjuna. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
There's no possibility of the Lord being
under the influence of ignorance at some point in the past, as mentioned in the
scriptures:</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >

[shvEtAshvatara]</span>
<span lang=EN-US style='font-size:8.0pt;line-height:150%' >
, 6-8</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
 says: The Lord's strength is described in many ways. Such strength
is His by nature, along with knowledge, strength and His activities. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
In <a href="Chapter%207.html#26">Chapter 7-26</a>, the Lord says: I know the
beings whose time has passed, who are present now and those who will be in the
future. However, there isn't anyone who knows Me.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
If indeed the Lord is the only one and the
rest are imaginary, the Lord would know that and so would the people He
teaches. Then whom will the Lord teach that there is only one? Everyone else
would be imaginary.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
What if there is only one and it appears
multiple - like reflections? Arjuna, receiving the teaching, is like a
reflection of the Lord. Any sane person wouldn't look at his own reflection on
a shining surface and clarify these distinctions to it.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
What if the Lord has the knowledge and is
still limited by past ignorance? That doesn't hold either, let's see why. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Having knowledge and still being limited
can be illustrated with an analogy - Suppose there is someone who sees two
moons due to a defect in his vision. Even after he knows that there's only one
moon, he can still see two moons. However, the defect in his sight doesn't
cause any harm anymore. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
This analogy doesn't hold in case of
Krishna. There's no possibility of any defect returning. If at all a teacher
has the complete knowledge that there is indeed a single Lord and nothing else
is real, there's no possibility for him to explain anything to anyone - because
they don't exist. If the teacher doesn't have such complete knowledge,&nbsp;he
cannot teach anyway. If the teacher is imaginary, then his teachings are also
imaginary. If the purpose of the teaching was to get rid of ignorance, it
applies to the teachers as well. If at all these distinctions are due to
ignorance and if the teacher is free of such 'ignorance', whom will he teach?</span>

When a person gives up childhood and gets
to be a youth in the same body, we reason that the person - his Self - is still
the same and don't grieve that 'the Self is destroyed'. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
In the same way, when the Self is done with
one body and gets another one, a wise and steadfast person would reason that it
isn't destroyed. Thus, every Self is ever-lasting and it's not something to
grieve about.</span>

<p class=MsoNormal >

What we must do here is just this. The
ever-lasting Self is under the influence of actions it has committed -
activities driven by outcomes, performed since beginning-less time. It gets
associated with a body due to such influence, which is in-line with those actions.
The Self is liberated from entrapment in such bodies by doing activities suited
to its body, as prescribed by the Lord - without being driven by outcomes. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Even while working without being driven by outcomes,
the organs of its body contact their stimuli - as always. This results in
feelings such as warmth and cold, triggering experiences of comfort or
discomfort. They must be endured till our duty is done.</span>

Touch, sound, form, taste and smell - all of
them lie in the primary elements of matter. This matter causes many experiences
within you, when it comes into contact with your organs. Organs that sense
events such as touch and sound give us feelings of cold, heat, hardness,
softness and so on. These feelings in turn lead to experiences of joy and
sorrow. Words like 'cold', 'heat', 'joy' and 'sorrow' are used as examples to
illustrate all your different experiences.</span>

In contrast, the body is a collection of

The body is subject to destruction by its
very nature. The Self is by nature everlasting. Hence, neither is to be grieved
over. Knowing this, be with courage; bear the inevitable effects of weapons on your
body and on others. Perform the act of war without expectations regarding the
outcome of your actions, with the intent of gaining freedom from birth and
death (<a href="Back%20to%20Basics.html#Moksha">moksha</a>

<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
People who believe that the Self (whose
qualities are described above) can kill, or in any way be a cause for killing, as
well as those who believe that it can be killed due to any cause, do not know. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Due to the facts mentioned before, also due

The Self cannot be killed either, due to the same facts. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The verb 'kill' has the Self as the object.
It refers to the act of separating the Self from the body. The fact expressed
is that the Self cannot be killed. In that case, what about the scriptures that
say 'One must not cause harm to animals', 'A student of the scriptures must not
be killed'? These statements forbid certain actions, referring to 'killing' in
the sense of separating the body from the Self.</span>

</p>


</div>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Due to the reasons mentioned above, the
Self is indestructible. It isn't subjected to the effects of nature and is not
subject to birth and death. Birth and death are natural to inanimate objects-
that's the message conveyed in the Shloka. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
'It is born, it will die': While birth and
death are experienced all the time in bodies belonging to each one of us, they do
not touch the Self at any time. The concepts of coming into being and ceasing
to exist do not apply to the Self.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
It means the Self has not come into being
at the time of creation (at the beginning of the <a href="Chapter%204.html#kalpa_definition">kalpa</a>
),
nor will it cease to exist at the time of destruction. Brahma, the principal
engineer of the universe, is born and will eventually die. So do all the other
great powers. Even in them, birth and death do not affect the Self. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
In this way, the Self in each body is
without birth. It is everlasting, doesn't get destroyed and isn't related to
the unending series of cause-effect changes in the environment. Though ancient,
the Self still seems to be new. It is experienced as though it had no past -
this is the meaning expressed here. Thus, the Self is not killed inside the
body that perishes.</span>

<span lang=EN-US >
 or kill anyone?</span>
</p>


</div>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The Self is indestructible, being without
birth and without wearing out. How can anyone with this awareness hurt any
body's Self? Or kill and destroy anyone? How can he even be the initiator of
the killing? - That is the message here. The feeling of sadness, such as 'I
will hurt the Self within them, I will kill them' - is caused by ignorance of
the real nature of the Self. That is the assertion here.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
This gives rise to a doubt - Even when we
know that death is merely the separation of the Self from the body, isn't the
disintegration of the body something to grieve about? After all, the body is a
medium to enjoy the good things in life. When the Self discards its body, isn't
it a sorrowful event? This doubt is addressed in the next Shloka.</span>

On the other hand, let's suppose you didn't
hear the above illustrations that the Self is different from the body. Let's
say you believe the body to be your Self, recycled across births and deaths as
a part of the environment. Even then it is inappropriate to feel so much
sorrow. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Creation and destruction are inevitable for
the body, since it is subject to the effects of the environment by its very
nature.</span>

<span class="snskrtphrase">[tvam shOchitum

<span lang=EN-US >
 does not qualify as something for you to
feel sorry about.</span>
</p>


</div>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The destruction of anything that's born is
certain - This inevitability is evident. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Also, it is inevitable that something that
has been destroyed comes into existence. How is it possible, that something
that has been destroyed is born again? </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
To answer the question, consider this: For
things that are perceived to exist, their creation is evident. For things that
don't seem to exist, it's not evident. Terms like creation and destruction
describe different states of an object that has existence. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
As an analogy, things that do exist, such
as threads, when put together, form something that's called cloth. The same
thing applies even to things that don't seem to exist - The thread changed its
context, it did not cease to exist.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
When things like clothes are created,
nothing else is observed, except that threads are put together in a pattern.
Merely by a transaction, or by using a different name, or by using it for a
different purpose, the thought that new matter has been created is not
appropriate. Thus, things like creation and destruction are different states of
an existing object. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
'Destruction' is said to happen when an
object, which is in the state called 'created', obtains a state that seems
opposite to its created state. For example, mud can exist in different states
such as 'dough-like-mass', as a 'pot', as 'pieces' and as 'powder'. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
In the same manner, any object that's
affected by its environment inevitably undergoes a series of transformations.
For an object that exists in a certain state, obtaining the next state is its
destruction. For the object in the succeeding state, obtaining that state itself
is its creation. Thus, it's inevitable that any object that's affected by its
environment undergoes a series of creations and destructions: There is no need
to feel sorry about this.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Even the slightest sorrow that may arise on
seeing an object change from one state to another does not arise in the case of
humans and other beings - The Lord states that next.</span>

<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Living beings such as humans are not
perceived in their previous state, before birth. They are perceived to exist as
'human' in the 'middle' states and are not perceivable in their succeeding
state after death. They will exist as per their nature. Hence, there is no
cause for sorrow. Even in the argument that the body and the Self are
identical, there is no cause for sorrow. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The Lord explained the amazing nature of
the Self and clarified that it's distinct from the body. Next, He says that it's
rare to find someone with definite knowledge of the Self, who talks about it,
listens and is in line with the listening.</span>

Nobody knows the Self as it really is. This

It should be learnt that the Self owns the

doesn't matter if those beings have different forms, be they <a href="Chapter%204.html#gods_and_other_powers">gods</a>
 or just stationary organisms. Any differences
in form and other temporary characteristics relate to the body alone. Hence,
you don't need to feel sad regarding any of the beings, including the Gods.
Leave alone Bhishma and others.</span>

It's not that you would only be deprived of
unparalleled joy and fame. The stigma of 'Arjuna ran away at the beginning of
the war itself' will stick to you for all time, and at all places. All people,
both the capable and the incapable ones, will say this. </span>

If your response to this is 'So what?',
then know this: You are a person esteemed for qualities such as bravery, valor
and daring. Dishonor comes to people like you, when you associate with the
opposite qualities. Such dishonor is even worse than death. The opinion
expressed in this Shloka is - death is indeed better, when compared to such
dishonor.</span>

This opinion has also been stated in one of

<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The Lord says 'Here, the intention that perseveres
to determine the nature of the Self is indeed one'. The word 'here' refers to
the entire field of conscious activities. In this field, He says 'the intention
that perseveres to determine the nature of the Self is indeed one'- meaning, the
intention of a person who works to attain <a href="Back%20to%20Basics.html#Moksha">moksha</a>
 is an intent
that has determination. The determination is to ascertain the true nature of
the Self. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
On the other hand, actions that are driven
by desires are without such resolve. When we are driven by desires, it's just
beneficial to know the distinction between the body and the Self. It's not
necessary to realize the true nature of the Self. Even without ascertaining the
real nature of the Self, it's possible to ask for desirable things, achieve
them and enjoy them- there is nothing to oppose this.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The 'focused intention to achieve
liberation' is said to be 'one', by virtue of having a single goal. A person
who has the determination to achieve liberation would initiate all activity for
the one end-result called <a href="Back%20to%20Basics.html#Moksha">moksha</a>
. Hence, given the same wisdom
behind these activities, there is a single intent that drives all the actions. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
As an analogy, take the intention to make
money for the sake of money itself. There may be many different activities that
can make money. The wisdom driving those activities is the practical awareness
of capital. The intention behind all those activities is the same.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
People without the determination to achieve
liberation are ruled by actions to achieve various outcomes, such as children,
wealth, food or a place in heaven. Due to the countless variety of outcomes,
the intentions that drive those actions are uncountable as well. Also, they
branch out variously in the form of differences and side-effect within the same
goal. Hence, the intentions of people who do not have such determination have
many branches and are countless.</span>

There are people who speak about results in
life. Their words are like flowers, beautiful on the outside. They have certain
characteristics: They know a little and speak about paths that bring about
enjoyment and wealth; they are interested in those parts of the Vedas that deal
with enjoyment; due to their attachment towards enjoyment, they say nothing
else exists. They indulge in their desires, and are driven by them. They think enjoyment
is the ultimate goal. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
After experiencing the high life, they
again experience birth and commit various actions - this is where their ideas
will lead. Due to ignorance, they preach activities that aim to beget enjoyment
and wealth.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
There are people who are misled by all this.
Their mind is abducted by such preaching and they end up indulging in enjoyment
and wealth. The intention to determine the true nature of the Self is absent in
such people. Their minds will never have the knowledge required for carrying
out actions that lead to <a href="Back%20to%20Basics.html#Moksha">moksha</a>
- actions which lead to
the true nature of the Self.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Hence, a person who desires <a href="Back%20to%20Basics.html#Moksha">moksha</a>
 must not associate with desire-driven actions.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Now, some questions arise: The Vedas deal
with the science of your Self with an affection that's greater than thousands
of parents. Why is it that the Vedas also preach actions that yield minor enjoyments,
which further the cycle of re-birth? Is it appropriate to say that the outcomes
prescribed in the Vedas are to be given up? Answers to these questions come in
the following Shlokas:</span>

Three
qualities influence all things that are created: <a href="Chapter%2014.html#sattva">sattva</a>

(wisdom, virtue, truth), <a href="Chapter%2014.html#rajas">rajas</a>
 (passion, emotion: cause of
great activity) and <a href="Chapter%2014.html#tamas">tamas</a>
 (ignorance, darkness). </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Some of us are associated with abundant
amounts of these three qualities. The Vedas deal with this subject: With great
compassion, they preach activities that are suitable for those of us with a prominent
influence of ignorance (<a href="Chapter%2014.html#tamas">tamas</a>
), for those in whom passion
(<a href="Chapter%2014.html#rajas">rajas</a>
) is prominent and for those in whom wisdom and
virtue (<a href="Chapter%2014.html#sattva">sattva</a>
) are prominent. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
In case the Vedas did not preach the means
to achieve goals suitable to our nature, we would get turned away from <a href="Back%20to%20Basics.html#Moksha">moksha</a>
, which is the goal of people with wisdom (<a href="Chapter%2014.html#sattva">sattva</a>
). We get turned away due to the influence of passion
and ignorance (<a href="Chapter%2014.html#rajas">rajas</a>
 and <a href="Chapter%2014.html#tamas">tamas</a>
). When
passion and ignorance get a hold on us, we wouldn't know what's appropriate to
achieve our desires and would become helpless. We would be overcome by
confusion as to what has to be attained and what not. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
That's why the Vedas deal with all the
above <a href="Chapter%202.html#satva_rajas_tamas">qualities</a>
.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
However, do not be a person influenced by
all the <a href="Chapter%2014.html#satva_rajas_tamas_effects">three qualities</a>
. You are now
situated in wisdom (<a href="Chapter%2014.html#sattva">sattva</a>
). Keep progressing in the same
way. Do not allow a mix of the three qualities control you. 'Be free from
dualities' by donning an attitude of disregard for all material things,
standing in wisdom (<a href="Chapter%2014.html#sattva">sattva</a>
) always, not being influenced
by the other two qualities. </span>

<p class=MsoNormal >

What is the way to achieve this? Let go of
the urge to acquire things that don't contribute to the realization of the
Self. Let go of protecting what you have acquired. Be someone who is interested
in the quest to find the true nature of the Self. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
When you conduct yourself this way, you
will rid yourself of the powerful influence of passion and ignorance (<a href="Chapter%2014.html#rajas">rajas</a>

Also, everything said in the Vedas is not
applicable to everyone. A thirsty person can only drink so much water from a
lake as he needs. Even though the lake is full of water, it was built with many
purposes in mind. Just as a person will not drink the whole lake, a person
desiring <a href="Back%20to%20Basics.html#Moksha">moksha</a>
 will only take the part that helps him
attain <a href="Back%20to%20Basics.html#Moksha">moksha</a>

<p class=MsoNormal >

When compared to such activities, others
are by far inferior. The two types of activities are indeed very distinct. When
you are aware of the Self while working, you get rid of all misfortune present

<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
As said before, do your work with the
awareness of the Self. Your intellect will cross over ignorance. Ignorance is something
that gets you addicted to the limited gratification given by sensual pleasures.
It prevents you from discerning the truth. This ignorance is caused by
attachments towards minor material outcomes. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
When your intellect crosses over this
ignorance, you will gain complete indifference to material outcomes. As I said
previously, let the outcomes go. Do as I am going to say next. You will
automatically free yourself of attachment.</span>

<p class=MsoNormal >

achievement called yoga. It is a predecessor to realizing the Self and has that
special knowledge built into it. It aims to get you to a higher level of being.</span>

<span lang=EN-US >
There is nothing which is similar to the
Self. It is everlasting and unsurpassed. Your intellect is specially enriched
by listening to what I said about the subtle Self. When the intellect is
focused on the Self, it stands firm in the mind that is cleaned by performing
actions without attachments. With your intellect focused in this way, you shall
attain yoga- the realization of the Self.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
This is explained as <a href="karmayoga.html#karmayoga">Karmayoga</a>
. It's
about working without attachments, a predecessor to realizing the Self. We
transform by working in this way, being engaged in cultivating our knowledge.
Such a state of engagement is called </span>
<span lang=EN-US >
[sthitaprajna]</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
. It is a state of 'being firm in wisdom' or 'free from confusion'.
This state of cultivating true knowledge achieves the realization of the Self.
We call it '<a href="Chapter%206.html#yoga_state_of_being">yoga</a>
'.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
After being taught in this way, Arjuna asks
about the characteristic of being firm in wisdom- a state in which we are free
from confusion. It comes from performing actions without attachments and leads
to the realization of the Self. He also asks about the conduct of a person who
is firm in wisdom.</span>

<a name="sthitaprajna_xlat" >

'firm in wisdom' is to be engaged in an inquiry into the Self, cultivating true

<span lang=EN-US >

Sense-organs experience sensual objects. Someone

<p class=MsoNormal >

<span lang=EN-US >
Sensory desires won't retreat until we see
the Self. In the presence of these desires, their powerful influence abducts our
sense organs by force. This happens even in those who have all the required
knowledge and want to be engaged in realizing the Self.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Thus, mastery over the sense organs depends
on realizing the Self. Realizing the Self requires mastery over the sense
organs. In this cycle, obtaining the ultimate knowledge about the Self is very
tough.</span>

I am a very favorable refuge for all

<p class=MsoNormal >

</div>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
A person who does not focus his mind on Me
wouldn't have lost his desire for sensual objects yet. Even when he controls
his sense organs, he will definitely indulge in thoughts about sensual objects.
This indulgence comes from the influence of infinite actions. He has committed
these actions since beginning-less time, all the while being driven by the desire
for outcomes.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
When he indulges in thoughts about sensory
objects, he will grow a strong attachment towards them again. From that
attachment, desire is born - the ripening of attachment is called desire.
Desire is a state in which a person is unable to stay without experiencing
things that stimulate the sense organs. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
From this desire, anger is born. There will
be a time when a person is denied something he desires. Then, he feels that
others are responsible and throws his anger at them. It's a feeling like 'Due
to them, I don't have what I like'.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Anger results in delusion- being insensitive
to what must be done and what must not. Due to this delusion, a person may do
anything at all - the awareness involved in controlling his sense organs and
other activities is lost. Due to loss of such understanding, the intellect
perishes. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The focus that he brought about to gain
realization of the Self is destroyed. Due to the loss of such intellect, he
falls back to material things and is wasted.</span>

Just as this person's mind attains
tranquility, any sorrow associated with material attachment disappears. The ability
to distinguish the Self is established in a person whose thoughts are clear, when
he is free from flaws that block his realization of the Self. This way, in the
tranquility of one's mind, all sorrows are destroyed.</span>

The 'state of being' in which you work

This state of being is a property of the person who is <a href="Chapter%202.html#sthitaprajna_xlat">free of confusion</a>

<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
You will not get carried away by material

attain the Self. You will realize the Self as having joy itself as its
characteristic.</span>

<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Thus, in the second chapter, Arjuna was
taught the knowledge of the eternal Self. Before this, he did not know the real
nature of the Self. He also didn't know that action in war can achieve the
realization of the Self. With the misconception that the body is the Self, he was
about to withdraw from the war. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
As a foundation to gain knowledge and get
rid of the misconception, Lord Krishna taught him the technique of <a href="karmayoga.html#karmayOga_a_defn">Karmayoga</a>
-
performing actions without attachment. It is a means to achieve <a href="Chapter%202.html#sthitaprajna_xlat">freedom from confusion</a>
.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
In summary: To resolve Arjuna's confusion,
the second chapter described the knowledge required to realize the eternal Self.
It also gives the knowledge required to work without attachments. The aim of
this knowledge is to be <a href="Chapter%202.html#sthitaprajna_xlat">firm in wisdom</a>
