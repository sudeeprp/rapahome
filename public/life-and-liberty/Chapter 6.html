<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Till now, The Lord spoke about <a href="karmayoga.html#karmayoga">working without
attachments</a>
, along with the methods that help in its practice. Now, He
explains the method to keep practicing the realization of the Self. It is accomplished
by <a href="karmayoga.html#karmayoga">activity</a>

and <a href="jnanayoga.html#jnAnayOga_a_defn">contemplation</a>
.
Once again, He explains that <a href="karmayoga.html#karmayoga">working without
attachment</a>
 has <a href="jnanayoga.html#jnAnayOga_a_defn">contemplation</a>

built into it. This is to emphasize the fact that <a href="karmayoga.html#karmayoga">such activity</a>
 doesn't
need additional methods to realize the Self.</span>

<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
A person who isn't driven by outcomes does
his work as activity, even without the expectation that good deeds will do him
good in return. This person works with an attitude- 'I do this to worship the
Supreme Lord&#8203;, who is the Self within every Self and our friend forever'.
This person works with the activity itself as the goal, not anything else
that's achieved.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
He has renounced all compulsions and is <a href="jnanayoga.html#jnAnayOga_a_defn">focused on
the knowledge of the Self</a>
. He is <a href="karmayoga.html#karmayoga">skillful in his
activity</a>
 as well. He is a champion in his activity, doing it as a form of
contemplating the Self.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
This Shloka says that such a person is not without
fire, neither is he idle. He is dedicated in his work and doesn't avoid it. As
described above, his activity is His worship. This dedication in activity is
his focus to realize the Self.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Next, The Lord says that contemplation and
realization are always embedded in such actions.</span>

<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
A person gives up expectations when he contemplates
the Self in its true form, being free of the notion that he is the body. As

Self and the body, getting attached to expectations. Such a person will not
work without being driven by desire.</span>

 He is said to be

</p>


</div>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
When a person works independent of desire,
he gives up attachment towards things that are unrelated to the experience of
the Self. These are things in the material world that stimulate sense organs -
taste, smell and so on. The natural inclination of this person is to realize
the Self alone. He gives up attachment to material stimuli and the activities
done to react on them. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
In this state, he is considered to be
situated firmly in the true nature of the Self, having freed himself of all
desires. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
However, a person who wants to ascend to
that state is still susceptible to the stimuli of the material world. Hence, he
needs to practice <a href="karmayoga.html#karmayoga">working
without being driven by desire</a>
, purely as worship to the Lord. In this way,
he practices the art of giving up attachment towards the material world and the
art of meditation to realize the Self. This technique of [<a href="karmayoga.html#karmayOga_a_defn">karmayOga</a>
]
is the only way available to him and he needs to practice just that.</span>

Eating too much, or not eating at all -
both of these are obstacles to realizing the Self. Getting diverted excessively
goes against realizing the Self. So does the avoidance of all leisure.
Similarly, sleeping too much, sleeping too less, exerting ourselves beyond
limit and avoiding exertion are obstacles to realizing the Self.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The realization of the Self happens to a person
who exercises control. This person is prudent in eating, leisure, exertion, in
sleep and in staying awake. Such a realization of the Self destroys all bondage
and limitation.</span>

Desires are of two types. The first type
comes out of contact with the material world - warmth, cold and so on. The
second type is born out of your wishes - such as the desire for a child or
territory. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Only by relying on your true nature, you get
the ability to look beyond your wishes. Focus your mind on the fact that
there's no logical connection between those desires and your Self. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Then, give up the limited happiness and
sorrow that arise out of unavoidable contact with the material world. Govern
the group of organs that form your body, even in the presence of all their
stimuli.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Little by little, you will let-go of things
other than the Self. You do this using knowledge obtained by perseverance.
Station the mind within the Self and don't be anxious about anything.</span>

as all beings and the Self in all beings having an identical form as his own.
Seeing one Self is the same as seeing the Self in all beings, due to their

The Self in every being, including
ourselves, has a single form - that of pure and unrestricted knowledge. Due to
this, all of them are similar. The person described in this Shloka is the one
who stands by this fact and considers the feelings present everywhere with
equanimity. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
These 'feelings' could be happiness such as
the birth of a son, and sadness such as his death. This person considers them
equally, as they are not related to him. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
To elaborate, he considers the birth and
death of his own son to be equal to the birth and death of another's son. This
person, who is in the quest for the Self is considered to be the ultimate -

Arjuna said- For a long time, the mind has
experienced a wide variety of beings, based on the differences between humans,
differences between our Self, the Lord and so on. Given the variety it has
encountered, I do not see a way in which the mind can be stationed firmly in
the idea of equality.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The idea of equality was illustrated by You
as the universal equivalence of all beings- All of them have a form that is
pure knowledge and are equivalent to the Lord's form, when they are not under
the influence of their past deeds. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
However, the mind has seen a wide variety
of humans and other beings. The mind is accustomed to reacting to the various
stimuli of the environment incessantly and is inherently volatile. Its entire
experience goes against this equivalence. Hence, it is not possible for a
person to make it stand in one place. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
This mind will divert the person by force
and firmly drive him elsewhere. Even among the stimuli he is used to, the mind
cannot stay at one thought - it keeps wandering. Moreover, the Self has
qualities that are opposite to the usual stimuli experienced by the mind. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Given all this, an attempt to make it stand
still in the Self is like controlling an unfavorable strong wind with a small
fan. It is extremely difficult, if not impossible.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
In this way, a desire to know the means to
control the mind is expressed.</span>

Lord Krishna replies- No doubt, the mind is
difficult to control. It wanders constantly by its very nature. Even then, it
can be brought under control by the excellence of the Self - which results from
the practice of its pure form and qualities. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Moreover, attachment to things other than
the Self leads to bondage. With this awareness, we get rid of the thirst for
various desires. With this and a little effort from the intellect, the mind can
be brought under our grip. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The pursuit of the Self is indeed
impossible - even with very heavy effort - if the mind is not under control. A
person needs to bring his mind under control, persevering by the methods
described before- being aware of the Self, <a href="karmayoga.html">working independent of desire</a>

to worship Me. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
With this, he gains the ability to practice
<a href="Chapter%206.html#yoga_state_of_being">yoga</a>
. He gains the ability to see everything
with equanimity.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Next, Arjuna requests to understand the
greatness of <a href="Chapter%206.html#yoga_state_of_being">yoga</a>
 in its true nature, in the
manner described in <a href="Chapter%202.html#40">Chapter 2-40</a>: 'While working without attachment towards outcomes,
something that has been started is not destroyed'. Over there, The Lord stated
that the preferred means to realization is the <a href="karmayoga.html">technique of working</a>

without being driven. The knowledge of the Self is embedded in it. This
greatness is the same as <a href="Chapter%206.html#yoga_state_of_being">the special state of
being</a>
 described in this chapter.</span>

Even though a person pursues the knowledge
of the Self in full faith, his mind may wander from the path of
Self-realization due to imperfections in the intensity of his efforts. Without
gaining the goal of realizing the Self, what state will he fall into? Just as a
fragment of cloud that has separated from a huge thunder-cloud perishes in the
midst of the sky, without being able to reach any other cloud, will he not
perish too? </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
How would it be, to lose out on both
counts? On one side, he has deviated from the path shown by the Lord, to
realize the Self. On the other, he is not interested in being driven by the
usual pleasures and goals of this world. He is also not interested in the outcome
of his actions. He doesn't seem to thrive in achieving material goals.</span>

<p class=MsoNormal >

A person
diverts from the path of realizing the Self due to some desires. This person
will then obtain worlds that are available to virtuous people. He enjoys those

Born in this way, he gains back the

that obstacles do not put him off anymore. </span>

Worship of the Lord has been his virtue. He
worships by working independent of desire. Having begun his quest to realize

pulled towards the same path, though he does not consciously focus his mind
upon it. The efficacy of this yoga is well-established.</span>

To understand this commentary, it is
necessary to know the usage of the various grammatical cases. The </span>

<i >
<span lang=EN-US >
[panchamI]</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
 case means 'in comparison to',
which denotes that the subject is distinct from the objects being compared. The

</i>
<i >
<span lang=EN-US >
[ShaShThI]</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
 case means
'among', which means the subject is one among the objects mentioned. In this
Shloka, the person being described is different from others. We must pick up
the 'in comparison to' case, not the 'one among the others' case.</span>
</i>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The Shloka describes a person, different
from all others who persevere to realize the Self. This description uses the
ablative case (which means a comparison and separation - the </span>
<span lang=EN-US >
[panchami vibhakti]</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
) to denote all the
others. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
People who persevere to realize the Self
were described at progressive stages of maturity, starting with <a href="Chapter%206.html#26">Chapter 6-26</a> till
<a href="Chapter%206.html#30">Chapter 6-30</a>. The person who is going to be described now is distinct from all
these four types. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The genitive case (denoting 'belongingness'
- the </span>
<span lang=EN-US >
[ShaShThI vibhakti]</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
) is
not used, since this person is not merely a special one among others. The
phrase 'even in comparison to all those who persevere to realize the Self' has
been used in this Shloka. The word 'all' over here includes the people who
perform penance and the others mentioned previously (<a href="Chapter%204.html#28">Chapter 4-28</a>). Even here, the
</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
[panchamI]</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
 case is to be
grasped, by the same logic mentioned before- the practitioner who is going to
be described now has focused his mind the most. He is distinct in comparison to
all those people.</span>

In comparison to this person, the
distinction between people mentioned previously (<a href="Chapter%204.html#28">Chapter 4-28</a>) is insignificant.
It is like comparing a fabulous mountain in the Himalaya and a minute mustard
seed. Even though the mustard seeds have a perceptible difference and
inequality among themselves, their insignificance is obvious when placed in
perspective with the mountain.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
This person has placed himself in Me by
extreme affection and with the conviction that there is no protector other than
Me. This person worships Me with strong intent and a sense of urgency to attain
me, since he cannot tolerate even a moment of separation from Me - again, by an
overload of affection towards Me. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
'Me' refers to Lord Krishna, whose playing
field is the creation, evolution and destruction of the entire universe, which
is endowed with a variety of things that are to be experienced, various species
of beings that experience it, things that help in experiencing it and places
where it can be experienced. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
This is The Lord, whom no flaw can
influence, who is an abode of unlimited amount of great knowledge, power,
wealth, courage, strength, brilliance and uncountable other auspicious
qualities, whose form is exactly the way He wishes, a form that is unthinkable
in its entirety - divine, extraordinary, eternal, flawless, with limitless brilliance,
beauty, aroma, tenderness, charm, youthfulness and is an abode to infinite such
qualities. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
His form and nature cannot be broken-down
and understood either through speech or thought. He is a vast ocean of
compassion, character, affection, generosity and protects all beings of the
universe without exception, without regard to any of their peculiarities. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
He takes away the pain from anyone who bows
and submits to Him. He is a sea of affection to them. He is not visible to any
human and never moves away from his true nature. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
This is Krishna, who has taken birth in the
house of Vasudeva, who brightens the world with his continuous and unsurpassed brilliance,
who fills the universe with his splendor - is the kind of Lord worshipped by
this person.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Lord Krishna concludes this chapter- I, the
Lord who always brings everything everywhere into realization in its true form,
consider this person to be the most focused, the best of the best among all
beings.</span>
