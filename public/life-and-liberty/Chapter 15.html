<h1>Chapter 15</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The 13th chapter clarified the environment
as the <a href="Chapter%2013.html#field_and_knower_of_field">field of action</a>
 and the Self as
<a href="Chapter%2013.html#field_and_knower_of_field">one who knows the field</a>
. Then, it
explained that the bond between the Self and the environment has no beginning.
Though the natural form of the Self is pure and unbounded knowledge, it is
bound in a body made from the environment. The Self is limited in this way, due
to the continuous flow of attachment to the <a href="Chapter%202.html#satva_rajas_tamas">three
qualities</a>
 in the environment. This attachment has no beginning, it has
always been there.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The 14th chapter explained the state of the
Self, bound in the environment, both before creation and after. It stated that
the bond with the environment originates in the attachment to the <a href="Chapter%2014.html#satva_rajas_tamas_effects">three qualities</a>
. It also stated that the
bond is made by the Lord himself. It laid out the nature of our attachment to
the <a href="Chapter%2014.html#satva_rajas_tamas_effects">three qualities</a>
 in detail.
Finally, it asserted that we cast away the attachment to <a href="Chapter%202.html#satva_rajas_tamas">material qualities</a>
 by <a href="Chapter%207.html#bhakti_a_defn">devotion
to the Lord</a>
. This <a href="Chapter%207.html#bhakti_a_defn">devotion</a>
 achieves the true
nature of the Self.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
In this chapter, the Lord begins to explain
that He, as the object of worship, is the Supreme Person. He is the owner of
all that's perishable and imperishable, along with all beings that are made
from them. He is also the owner of all <a href="Back%20to%20Basics.html#Moksha">free</a>
 beings. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
By being the owner, by repelling all that's
undesirable, by being pure prosperity, He is totally supreme and distinct from
anything else. The Self is The Lord's possession, known as The Eternal. It is <a href="Back%20to%20Basics.html#Moksha">free from all bondage</a>
 after its bonds with the material
environment are cut off. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Attachment to things that <a href="Chapter%2014.html#happenings">happen</a>
 in the material environment become the bonds that
bind the Self. The sword of detachment is used to cut these bonds. To describe
this magnificent possession of the Lord, He illustrates this attachment as a
pepal tree with its roots at the top - the attachment must be cut.</span>

The word </span>
</i>
<i >
<span lang=EN-US >
[ashvattha]</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
 has been translated as 'pepal tree'. This word can also be broken
up as </span>
</i>
<i >
<span lang=EN-US >
[shva:]</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
, which
means tomorrow, </span>
</i>
<i >
<span lang=EN-US >
[ashva:]</span>
<span lang=EN-US >

meaning 'not tomorrow'. So </span>
</i>
<i >
<span lang=EN-US >
[ashvattha:]</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
 means 'that which is not present tomorrow'. When this is used to
describe the material world, it illustrates the temporary nature of this world.
Yet, this Shloka says it does not wear out. How come? Read on...</span>
</i>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Several scriptures refer to the material
environment as a pepal tree that doesn't wear out, with its roots on top and
branches below. The </span>
<span lang=EN-US style='line-height:150%' >
[kaThA
upanishat]</span>
<span lang=EN-US style='line-height:150%' >
, 6-1</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
 says 'With its roots at the top and branches below, this pepal tree
is ancient'. </span>
<span lang=EN-US >
[yajur vEda]</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
,
1-11-5 says 'The person who knows the pepal tree well - with the roots above
and branches below - is the one who knows'.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Its roots are said to be at the top, since
the universe started with Brahma at the top. Brahma is the principal architect
who made the universe happen. The various beings of the universe - plants,
microbes, birds, animals and so on - are of different types, classified as
branches in the tree down below. We can't cut away the flow of material
experiences as long as we ignore reality and remain attached. In this way, the
tree, representing the material world, does not wear out. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The leaves of this pepal tree are said to
represent the Vedas. The Vedas specify the methods to achieve material goals
like wealth and family. The world grows with these activities - hence the Vedas
are like the leaves of this tree. The growth of a tree is due to the
nourishment supplied by the leaves. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The Vedas themselves specify the method to
cut ourselves free from the tree that's the material world. The person who
knows such a pepal tree is the one who knows the Vedas. This person knows the
nature of this tree, which must be cut. He also knows the method to cut his
attachment to it. Hence, he is called 'the one who knows the Vedas'.</span>

Humans and others
are the branches of the tree. This tree spreads its branches with the deeds of
humans. It sprouts more branches below, in the form of more humans and other
beings. It spreads branches above, in the form of more powerful beings. </span>

<p class=MsoNormal >

These branches expand with the three
qualities of <a href="Chapter%2014.html#sattva">sattva</a>
, <a href="Chapter%2014.html#rajas">rajas</a>
 and <a href="Chapter%2014.html#tamas">tamas</a>
. Those shoots and sprouts are the stimuli present in
the environment - sounds, touch, form, taste and smell. How do the shoots and
sprouts figure over here? That is explained next -</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
This tree has Brahma, the principal
engineer of the universe, at its root at the top. It has humans down below in
its branches. These branches form the 'source' or the basis for activities
driven by desire. This is the base for us to get entangled in our actions.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
In this way the branches sprout and get
progressively denser in the world of humans, with little influence from the
Brahma at the root. Human beings progress to higher and more powerful lives, or
get degraded to lower life forms, depending on their actions.</span>

</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Its branches have further spread upwards
and downwards based on the activities of humans. This form of the material
world is not apparent to people who are bound in it. Mere facts are apparent to
us, such as 'I am a human', 'I am born to my parents', 'I am the parent of my
children' and 'I transact and experience the world accordingly'.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
We cannot see its end either - it's not
apparent that this tree is cut off by the absence of attachment towards
material experiences. Attachments are full of the <a href="Chapter%2014.html#satva_rajas_tamas_effects">three qualities</a>
. It is not apparent that
ignorance is the basis of its continued existence. Ignorance is the
consideration that our body is the Self.</span>

This <a href="Chapter%2015.html#pepal_tree">pepal tree</a>

which was described before, is famous for its numerous well-grown roots and
shoots. By knowing it, a person uses the 'weapon of decoupling' to cut free of

To get rid of ignorance, we must <a href="Chapter%207.html#Sharanagati">surrender</a>
 to that very Person who is the origin of
everything - 'that very Person' is the Lord - He described Himself in
<a href="Chapter%209.html#10">Chapter 9-10</a>: 'The material environment guides this world according to My will, I
being the supreme controller', in <a href="Chapter%2010.html#8">Chapter 10-8</a>: 'I am the origin of everything; Each

<p class=MsoNormal >

In the entire created universe, 'binding
activities' spring forth from the Lord. These binding activities are full of
the <a href="Chapter%2014.html#satva_rajas_tamas_effects">three qualities</a>
 and attachment to
experiences. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The fact that the Lord is the origin and
that we must surrender to Him was described by the Lord Himself previously, in
<a href="Chapter%207.html#14">Chapter 7-14</a>: ''These divine creations of Mine are pervaded by the <a href="Chapter%202.html#satva_rajas_tamas">three qualities</a>
. They are indeed impossible to
cross over. The people who <a href="Chapter%207.html#Sharanagati">surrender</a>

they will cross over this material world'. </span>

There is an alternate way to read this

<span lang=EN-US >
 can also be read as </span>
<span lang=EN-US >
[prapadya iyata:

<span lang=EN-US >
, which means 'By <a href="Chapter%207.html#Sharanagati">surrender</a>
,
the full extent of achievements are possible'. With this reading, the meaning
of the Shloka is:</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
By surrendering to that very Person who is
the origin of everything, all achievements - including the freedom from
ignorance - come forth in their full extent. This way of <a href="Chapter%207.html#Sharanagati">surrender</a>

is ancient and has been practiced by people who desire <a href="Back%20to%20Basics.html#Moksha">moksha</a>

It is in practice since <a href="Chapter%202.html#beginningless_time">beginning-less time</a>

The Lord says here - 'Since ancient times, those who desire <a href="Back%20to%20Basics.html#Moksha">moksha</a>

have surrendered to Me and are free from all bonds'.</span>

People who are ignorant do not recognize
the Self in the form of pure knowledge, distinct from the flesh that
constitutes a human form. They do not notice it in any circumstance - They don't
recognize the Self when it is born in flesh - in human form or any another form.
These forms are made out of the material world, full of the <a href="Chapter%2014.html#satva_rajas_tamas_effects">three qualities</a>
. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
They do not notice it when it has departed
from a specific body or even when it is situated inside a body. They don't even
recognize it when it's experiencing the stimuli in the environment, which are
again full of the <a href="Chapter%2014.html#satva_rajas_tamas_effects">three qualities</a>

Ignorant people are conceit in the opinion that the flesh, in the form of their
body, is their 'Self'.</span>

Up until now, it was explained that light
removes darkness. Darkness prevents material stimuli from coming into contact
with our sense organs. The sun, the moon and sources of light such as fire get
rid of darkness, enabling us to perceive the material world. In this way, light
enables the eye to sense the material world. </span>

everything, even the sources of light. Being the light of awareness, it knows

Previously, it was said that the Self is an
attribute of the Lord, both in its free form as well as in its bound form: <a href="Chapter%2015.html#6">Chapter 15-6</a>
said 'After reaching this free state of being, they do not return. That abode
is My supreme attribute'. <a href="Chapter%205.html#7">Chapter 5-7</a> said 'In this material world, where every
Self is bound in the environment, the ever-existing Self is definitely a part
of Me'.</span>

The Lord says- I am present at the heart of
all beings, the place where the awareness called 'consciousness' comes from.
This 'consciousness' is the awareness that brings the experience of
pleasantness, initiates the process of digestion and governs all activities
that are performed or stopped in all beings. In this way, I am at the core of
all beings, regulating everything by My will. The scriptures say the same:</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
[ya.aa]</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
, 3-11-2
says - 'He is the core of the Self in everyone, ruling them and pervading them
from the inside'.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
[br'hadArAnyaka]</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
,
3-7-3 says - 'He who is situated in the earth...'</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
[br'hadArAnyaka]</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
,
3-7-22 says - 'He is present in the Self while being distinct from the Self. He
rules the Self from the inside'</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
[mahA nArAyaNa]</span>
<span lang=EN-US >

says - 'The heart is like a lotus flower facing downwards. Everything is
present within, in a subtle form'.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
[ChAndOgya]</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
, 8-1-1
says - 'In this body, which is the Lord's place of residence, there is a small
lotus, with a small space. That space is the Lord in subtle form', after which
it goes on to describe the qualities of that space - its intent is always
fulfilled, it has infinite joy, it has no thirst and so on - these are the
qualities of the Lord.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
In the </span>
<span lang=EN-US >
[viShNu
purANa]</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
, 1-17-20 Prahlada tells his father - 'Vishnu is
the ruler of everything in the world, without exception, He pervades
everything'. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
[manu smr'ti]</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
,
12-122 says - 'He controls everything, being smaller and subtle beyond anything
else'.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
[manu smr'ti]</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
, 8-92
says - 'The Lord, who is the controller and the regulator, is present at your
heart'</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Hence, everyone's memory comes from Me.
This 'memory' is the awareness that comes from merely re-living a past
experience. Awareness is to infer and recognize things based on experiences
from various organs. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Forgetfulness and the inability to reason
is from Me. The power to reason comes from Me, as well as the ability to anticipate,
says the Lord. This comes to us in the form of 'I have learnt this fact (a fact
like gravity); I see the situation (like a stone being tossed); I can reason
what's next (the stone will fall)'. The chain of events that happens after this
(the stone hurting someone) adds to our learning. In this Shloka, The Lord said
'All this comes from Me'. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
'I alone am to be known from all the Vedas'
- The Vedas describe natural phenomena like fire, wind, the Sun, the Moon, acts
of nature and so on. I am inside all of them, at the core of their Self. Hence,
I am the One to be known from all the Vedas. The words 'human', 'god' and all
others refer to the Self in them. The Vedas describe the methods of worshipping
the gods, along with the results of such worship. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
It is the Lord who is being worshipped by
all methods, being at the core of every Self.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
'I make the end of the Vedas' - the Vedas
end in the fruits of the actions they prescribed. 'Making the end' here means
that the Lord makes the fruits - He is the One who gives the result stated in
the Vedas.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
This was stated previously, starting with
<a href="Chapter%207.html#21">Chapter 7-21</a> and <a href="Chapter%207.html#22">Chapter 7-22</a>: 'Which ever devotee likes to please what ever form
with dedication, I give stability to the same faith in each of them. With that
dedication, the person wishes to worship accordingly. By this he attains his
desires. These desires are given by Me alone' and in <a href="Chapter%209.html#24">Chapter 9-24</a>: 'I am indeed
the enjoyer and the single Master of all services rendered to anyone or
anything. Those who crave for material wealth do not know Me as I am. Hence,
they fall back'.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
'I am the One who knows the Vedas': All the
Vedas describe and address the Lord. The Lord says 'I know this fact'. Those
who speak other meanings of the Vedas do not know the Vedas - that is the
opinion expressed here.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
'Hence, listen to the one summary of all
the Vedas from Me' - continues the Lord.</span>

 the imperishable.</span>
</p>


</div>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
In My Universe, the perishable and imperishable
beings are well-known. The person termed 'perishable' here is what we call
'living beings', starting with Brahma, the principal engineer of the material
world, right up to even single-celled organisms. It's in their nature to wither
and perish, being created in combination with materials. In this Shloka, they
are all bundled together as one person, since they all have a common
characteristic - they are bound in the material world.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The one who does not change, called as the
'imperishable' is free from the attachment to the inanimate material world. He
is <a href="Back%20to%20Basics.html#Moksha">free</a>
 by nature and stays in his natural form. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Without attachments to anything inanimate,
he does not have any characteristics to differentiate him. The rest of us are differentiated
by the body we are bound to. That includes Brahma too. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Since the <a href="Back%20to%20Basics.html#Moksha">free</a>
 Self
does not vary, he is also called as 'invariant'. Just as an anvil stays
invariant while forging, every Self remains without changing. Since all of them
are common in their characteristic of being <a href="Back%20to%20Basics.html#Moksha">free</a>
 from the
material world, this Shloka groups them together as 'the imperishable'. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
This group is not restricted to those who
have been <a href="Back%20to%20Basics.html#Moksha">free</a>
 forever - it also includes those who are <a href="Back%20to%20Basics.html#Moksha">free</a>
 now, who were bound previously - as said in <a href="Chapter%204.html#10">Chapter 4-10</a>:
'Many people have taken refuge in Me, discarding desire, fear and anger. They
fill Me in their minds. They have been purified by pursuing My knowledge in a
single-minded way and have attained My qualities' and in <a href="Chapter%2014.html#2">Chapter 14-2</a>: 'Having
gained this knowledge, they achieve My characteristics. They are not born again
even at the time of creation, nor do they perish when the universe perishes'</span>

<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
In the previous Shlokas, it was mentioned
that those who are bound in the material world are perishable, while those who
are <a href="Back%20to%20Basics.html#Moksha">free</a>
 from the material world are imperishable. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
However, the supreme person is neither of
them. He has distinct characteristics and is called the Ultimate Self in all
the scriptures. The reference [paramAtmA] - 'The Ultimate Self' implies that
the Supreme Person is distinct from both the bound and <a href="Back%20to%20Basics.html#Moksha">free</a>

beings. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
How is He distinct? This Shloka states: 'He
pervades the three domains and supports them'. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The Lord looks over them, hence they are
called as domains (the Sanskrit word </span>
<span lang=EN-US >
[lOka]</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
, also used to mean the world and its people, comes from </span>
<span lang=EN-US >
[lOkyatE]</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
, which means 'they are looked
over'. The English word 'domain' also comes from the Latin word <i >
dominus</i>
,
meaning 'the lord who looks over').</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The three domains are known from the
scriptures. They are: Inanimate matter, Conscious beings who are bound with it,
Conscious beings who are <a href="Back%20to%20Basics.html#Moksha">free</a>
 from it.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The Lord pervades all three of them as the
core of their Self and supports them. In this way, He is distinct from those
who are pervaded and supported by Him. This person, who has been described as
being distinct, is the Lord. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
He does not wear out. In this way, He is
unlike the material world, which does wear out. Since He is not bound by
matter, He is distinct from all beings that are attached to matter. By being
the Lord and controller of everything, He is unlike the other beings that are
free of the material world as well.</span>

The Lord says in this Shloka - 'The person

What's the Supreme Person like? </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The Supreme Person was described as being

from the characteristics of never wearing out, pervading everything, supporting
everything and controlling everything. </span>

<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
So, the Lord says - 'The Person who knows
Me as the Supreme Person knows everything - he knows all about the means to achieve

In this Shloka, The Lord also says - 'This

<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
To achieve me, this person worships Me by
all known means of worship. The affection I get by knowing everything about Me
and the affection I get by chanting everything about Me - both these affections
are born to Me, by worshipping Me as the Supreme Person.</span>
