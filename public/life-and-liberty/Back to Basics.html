Many words in Sanskrit and English have
multiple meanings. Let's fix an interpretation to frequently encountered words.
This interpretation may be different from what we're accustomed to. If you
don't understand even after reading this, don't worry. Stay in the journey of
inquiry and don't get anxious about answers.</span>

<h3 >
<span lang=EN-US >
[Atma]</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
 - The Self</span>
</h3>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
As the Lord Himself states, it is not
possible to describe the </span>
<span lang=EN-US >
[Atma]</span>
<span lang=EN-US >

in speech, nor is it possible to understand it using the intellect. Needless to
say, the word </span>
<span lang=EN-US >
[Atma]</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
 is
difficult to translate. I have used the word 'Self' with an uppercase 'S' as
the translation of the word </span>
<span lang=EN-US >
[Atma]</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Rather than thinking about the </span>
<span lang=EN-US >
[Atma]</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
 as a ghostly soul, consider it as
being 'me'. The Self is 'me'. That brings us to the question 'What am I?' Let's
start by seeing what the Self isn't.</span>
</p>


<table class=ApplNotes border=0><tr><td class=ApplNotes align="center"><img class=ApplNotesImg src="step_0.png"></td><td><p class=ApplNotes id=inlineapplnote1 >
<span lang=EN-US style='color:black' >
I am not my body, am I?</span>
</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Am I a body, a walking bundle of cells and
chemicals, a machine that keeps responding to stimuli? If that's the case, I
would be a different 'me' through my life - the molecules in our body, our
shape, size, even our knowledge and memory - none of them are constant through
the life of the body. However, I still remain 'me' throughout my life even if
every aspect of my body gets replaced along the way.</span>
</p>


<table class=ApplNotes border=0><tr><td class=ApplNotes align="center"><img class=ApplNotesImg src="step_1.png"></td><td><p class=ApplNotes id=inlineapplnote2 >
<span lang=EN-US style='color:black' >
I am not just a
thought, am I?</span>
</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Let' go a little deeper. Am I my brain? The
brain is part of the nervous system, which routes all stimuli through its
circuits. Those circuits are nerve cells insulated from each other by fatty
tissue, connected through gaps in the insulation. This is known to be the way
memory is built and information is processed.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
There are thoughts in the brain that seem
to run on their own. They seem to have an existence independent of external
stimuli - something that I hear in my head when I just sit around doing
nothing. It's the 'chatterbox center'. Somewhere in the brain, my 'identity' is
located, which could be a 'memory of me'. It says things like 'I am short,
arrogant, intelligent but lazy' and so on. Do these centers constitute 'me'?
Does it cause the experience of 'I exist'?</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
No, these thoughts can change over time
while I remain 'me'. If I change my identity, maybe become an active person
from a lazy one, do I become a different 'me'? No. When I grow old and lose
some memory and other mental faculties, 'I' still exist. The experience of 'I
exist' is perhaps part of what's called 'consciousness'.</span>

<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The current state of the art has not
revealed the true nature of our consciousness. What is consciousness made of?
Does it follow any laws of conservation? Did it exist when the universe was
created? Is it responsible for the awareness and experience of the universe?
Are there different types of consciousness?</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Let's use the term 'Self' to refer to that
which gives rise to 'consciousness'. The Lord begins his conversation with
Arjuna by describing the nature of the Self in the second chapter. He then
explains the method of realizing it.</span>

<p class=MsoNormal >
<a name="karmayOga_a_defn" >
</a>
<span lang=EN-US >
Yoga is
about realization - a journey to get real. To associate facts and observations,
gain knowledge and materials required to realize our objective. We commonly use
the word 'yoga' to mean the postures and activities that go into realizing the
capabilities of our body and mind. This word has a deeper meaning. </span>

</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Three forms of yoga are seen in the
conversation of the Gita.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
First, the Lord reveals the art of practicing
yoga in all our activities. It's about realizing that we aren't entitled to any
outcomes, that the Lord is the enjoyer and the purpose of our actions. This is
reality. Practicing this reality is called </span>
<span lang=EN-US >
[karmayOga]</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Second, He describes yoga in our thoughts. This
is the realization that we are not our body; that the Self exists for the Lord;
that The Lord is all-powerful and acts according to His principles. This is
real knowledge and its practice is called </span>
<span lang=EN-US >
[jnAnayOga]</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Third, He talks about practicing yoga in
devotion. It is to adore the Lord and have Him in our thoughts always. This is
our state of being and our relationship with the Lord. Such practice is called </span>
<span lang=EN-US >
[bhaktiyOga]</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Yoga - be it postures, the forms described
above, a study of a science or contemplation - each of them is a journey in our
understanding of the material universe, our body as a part of the universe, us
and our relationship with the Lord. Such understanding comes with equanimity.</span>

<span lang=EN-US style='color:black' >
Our journey in life is
a series of activities. Is it about 'doing' or 'making it happen'?</span>
</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The word </span>
<span lang=EN-US >
[karma]</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
 is used in many contexts, so let's pick the basic meaning - any activity
and any action we initiate is called </span>
<span lang=EN-US >
[karma]</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
. An 'action' is something we do with an intention. Activity happens
in the material universe. We experience outcomes.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The distinction between actions, activities,
happenings, goals and outcomes can be hazy, so let's clarify with an example -
Let's say I intend to call my friend. I initiate the action by picking up the
phone and dialing. The action itself is accomplished by the activities of my
body. The call is transmitted by electromagnetic waves. My friend needs to
receive the call. That's when the call happens. In this manner, I intend to do
something and initiate an action. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Many things need to come together to make
the activity 'happen'. Only one of them is 'me'. The belief that I make things
happen is not reality. You may remark that none of it would happen unless I
initiated the action. That would be right - I am entitled only to an
independent intention and an initiation of the action. I don't make the rest of
the story happen, though I can predict what happens in material terms. What I
cannot predict is the outcome.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
An activity has an outcome that we
experience. Let's take the example ahead- suppose my friend responds cheerfully
to my call. Normally I would experience joy. However, if I were under a lot of
stress, I may feel envy. Suppose my friend didn't answer my call. I could get
frustrated. Or I could simply call later.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
In this way, we initiate an action with
some intention. After that, things happen, followed by an outcome in the form
of an experience. </span>
<span lang=EN-US >
[karma]</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
 is
the initiation of the activity. It's not to be mixed up with what actually
happens, or with any outcomes encountered along the way.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
These outcomes and experiences form the
'fruit' of the action, called </span>
<span lang=EN-US >
[karmaphala]</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
. The results that follow my actions can give me joy or sorrow,
depending on my attachment towards the action and its result. An outcome
doesn't belong to the action - by doing something, I am not entitled to a
particular experience. If I don't recognize this, I tie my activity to my
experience and will be bound by it. Such activity wouldn't be liberating
anymore, it would be pretty depressing.</span>

<h3 >
<span lang=EN-US >
[dharma]</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
 - That which uplifts</span>
</h3>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
It is the first word in the Gita and
appears many times in the epic. Often, it's translated to mean 'righteousness',
which gives the impression that there is always 'one right thing'. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
That's not always the case. For instance,
is it right to tolerate the mistakes of our dear ones? Or confront them even at
the cost of friendship? Righteousness is indeed confusing, so Yudhishtira asks
Bhishma at the end of the war- 'Which </span>
<span lang=EN-US >
[dharma]</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
 do you consider superior?' - implying many righteous behaviors. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Consider </span>
<span lang=EN-US >
[dharma]</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
 as a purpose that uplifts you. Usually, such an 'uplifting' would liberate
you to see an even higher purpose. For instance, let's say you set out to earn
money and achieve your goal legally. This may liberate you to pursue your interests,
or it may open opportunities to make even more money. Which </span>
<span lang=EN-US >
[dharma]</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
 you pick is your choice.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
This brings us to the distinction between
goals, means, purpose, expectation and outcomes. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Let's take an example - the activity of
cooking. The 'goal' is 'what' you're making - a meal, in this case. The 'means'
is 'how' you're making it, including the utensils, recipe, and items that go
into making the meal. The 'purpose' says 'why' you're doing it. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The purpose of cooking could be to eat, to
feed your family, to feed guests, to earn money, as a duty or just for the love
of cooking. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The 'expectation' is linked to desire - it's
what we want for ourselves from the activity. In this example, while cooking
for the family, we could expect appreciation; we could also expect them to
simply finish the food. Something happens as an outcome of the activity. Our
experience of the outcome depends on how we relate it to our expectations.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
In all of this, </span>
<span lang=EN-US >
[dharma]</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
 relates to the purpose. Your purpose 'uplifts' you in varying
degrees- cooking for the love of cooking may be more uplifting than just doing
it for someone else. On the other hand, if you're doing it for someone whom you
adore, that may be more uplifting than doing it for yourself.</span>
</p>


<table class=ApplNotes border=0><tr><td class=ApplNotes align="center"><img class=ApplNotesImg src="step_2.png"></td><td><p class=ApplNotes id=inlineapplnote9 >
<span lang=EN-US style='color:black' >
Look beyond desire.
Focus on the purpose even when you don't reach the goal you expect.</span>
</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
With this example, I know the meaning of </span>
<span lang=EN-US >
[dharma]</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
 but its application remains shady.
Do I consider my duty and profession to be above personal relationships? Or
cater to the needs of my dear ones, disregarding rights and opportunity when
they come in the way? What is the purpose of my activities? </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The problem of purpose appears again and
again in the Mahabharata. The resolution is also consistently stated each time:
Look beyond desires. Focus on purpose and don't go behind outcomes. Have the
Lord as your purpose and worship Him. At this point, there doesn't seem to be a
logical link from the 'problem of purpose' to the 'resolution by worship'. That's
the journey of the Gita.</span>
</p>


<h3 >
<span lang=EN-US >
[yajna]</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
 - An act of worship</span>
</h3>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
To 'worship' is to 'honor and adore'. Doing
this consciously means doing it according to a procedure. Though the word </span>
<span lang=EN-US >
[yajna]</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
 is often used to mean 'sacrifice', here
we consider the more general meaning of 'worship'.</span>

What's it like to be

</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
We cannot really imagine this state of
being, since we've never been free of all limitations. To start with, we need
to live with the limitations of our body. Then there is the limitation that
comes from our desires and attachments - which may come from things we own, the
society, family or friends. </span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
All of them are undoubtedly valuable - be
it the body, the society, family or friends. We cannot accomplish much without
them. The question is: How many activities do we initiate, expecting to gain or
maintain them? How many activities do we initiate independently, after which
the rest of the story comes together to make it </span>
<span lang=EN-US >
<a href="Back%20to%20Basics.html#actions_and_happenings">happen</a>
?</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
It isn't necessary to have expectations
whenever we initiate something. In fact, expectations are limiting in nature. Take
the activity of singing, for instance. When I expect appreciation and sing, I
do not feel much liberty in the initiative, being constrained by my impression
of the audience. Even when I'm appreciated, it's temporary and I need more
appreciation the next time. It doesn't liberate me in any way. On the other
hand, if I sing for the joy of singing, it feels more liberating. There is no
question of failure while I'm enjoying my singing. Though I may delight in an
activity in this way, repeating the same thing feels boring and my initiative
reduces. Then, such an initiative is not totally liberating either.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
What if there is a purpose that we're always
meant to achieve? What if any initiative towards that purpose was never to
fail? What if that purpose is easy and always delightful, no matter how many
times it's repeated, no matter how much criticism happens? Being in such a
purpose is the ultimate liberty. That purpose is the Lord. Achievement of that
purpose is Moksha.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Those who are in this purpose </span>
<span lang=EN-US >
<a href="karmayoga.html">are not driven</a>

by the world.</span>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal >

<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
Let's examine a few more words before we
get started with the Bhagavad-Gita.</span>
</p>


<h3 >
<span lang=EN-US >
[anAdi kAla]</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
 - Beginning-less time
</span>
</h3>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
It's the time that transcends the creation
and destruction of the universe. As opposed to this, the 'normal' time is the
one we experience, which starts with the creation of this universe.</span>
</p>


<h3 >
<span lang=EN-US >
[vishEShaNa]</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
 - Attribute</span>
</h3>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
An attribute is a property that cannot
exist on its own. For example, 'red color' is an attribute of blood: the
attribute of 'redness' cannot exist on its own: there has to be an object that
shows up as red, for the attribute to exist. Likewise, we and our universe are
attributes of the Lord.</span>
</p>


<h3 >
<span lang=EN-US >
[mana:]</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
 - The mind </span>
</h3>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The mind is an instrument for the Self to
experience this universe. Understanding, perception, intelligence and cognition
come from the mind.</span>
</p>


<h3 >
<span lang=EN-US >
[buddhi]</span>
<span lang=EN-US >
 - The intellect </span>
</h3>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
The intellect gives the ability to reason
and distinguish.</span>
</p>


<h3 >
<span lang=EN-US >
References to the Lord:</span>
</h3>


<p class=MsoNormal >
<span lang=EN-US >
All references to the Lord, including
pronouns, start with an uppercase letter. For example: The Lord said 'I make
Myself come into being by My own will'.</span>
